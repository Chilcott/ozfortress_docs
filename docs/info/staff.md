## Team Leads/Heads
Have an issue that isn't within the Sixes or Highlander realm? Good chance our Team Leads/Heads will have an answer for you. As always, we ask that you go through either `#sixes-support` / `#highlander-support` / `#ticket-support` within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H "If you have issues with verification, please contact an administrator via the sidebar in Discord.") first before contacting one of us directly.

## Public Behaviour Panel members
There are two Behaviour Panel members who are public, with three members who are not. We leave this decision purely up to the individual, however we do ask that those in an administration role are public-facing if possible. We will always strive to have an equal ratio of staff/non-staff members, if not more members who are not serving in an administration role.
