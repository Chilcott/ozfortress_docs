# Current & Past Staff
## Team Leads/Heads
Have an issue that isn't within the Sixes or Highlander realm? Good chance our Team Leads/Heads will have an answer for you. As always, we ask that you go through either `#sixes-support` / `#highlander-support` / `#ticket-support` within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H "If you have issues with verification, please contact an administrator via the sidebar in Discord.") first before contacting one of us directly.

## Public Behaviour Panel members
There are currently three Behaviour Panel members who are public, with two members who are not. We leave this decision purely up to the individual, however we do ask that those in an administration role (or those who were) are public-facing if possible. We will always strive to have an equal ratio of staff/non-staff members, if not strive for more members who are not serving in an administration role.

| Name | Discord |
| ---- | ------- |
| [core](https://ozfortress.com/users/491) (Head of Behaviour Panel) | [@coreobs](https://discordapp.com/users/226205616773922816) |
| [snazzy](https://ozfortress.com/users/37 "Please DO NOT contact panel members, contact the Head of the Behaviour Panel only.") (Panel member) | [@thelampshade22](https://discordapp.com/users/125913179690631169) |
| [ory](https://ozfortress.com/users/1303 "Please DO NOT contact Advisors, they no longer actively sit on the panel.") (Advisor) | N/A |
| [samson](https://ozfortress.com/users/205 "Please DO NOT contact Advisors, they no longer actively sit on the panel.") (Advisor) | N/A |

Those above marked with Advisor are only on the panel in an advisory capacity. Advisors are only called upon in difficult/edge cases or when we need another opinion. Those in the Advisor role will only ever be past long-serving panel members, panel leads, Head Admins, etc.

**Please DO NOT contact panel members or advisors directly**. The only public point of contact should ever be the Head of the Behaviour Panel or League Director. This is so all reports, queries, etc - go through the appropriate avenues and processes.
