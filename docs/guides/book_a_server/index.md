## How to Book

Bookings are done in the official ozfortress Discord. Simply join the [#bookings](https://discord.gg/5vs4C5C) channel and say “/booking create”, and the bot will step you through above the chat area as to what parameters are required. Upon filling out the command with everything needed, the server will be sent to your Discord user via DMs. For a full list of commands, please refer to [Qixalite's booking docs](https://docs.v2.qixalite.com/guides/games/tf2/), but you can find a basic list of commands below:

### Additional Information
If logs.tf is experiencing downtime, please be sure to download the server logs using the command via Reginald (or via Qixalite’s Hive Control Panel) and post a link to the download in-match communications. A screenshot of the scoreboard will not suffice. If you have questions regarding this, feel free to contact an ozfortress League Administrator.
