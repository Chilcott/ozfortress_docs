!!! success "Notice"
    The Behaviour Panel reserves the right to issue infractions and/or ban to a person based on the offence, including offences committed whilst that person is already serving a ban.

## About Player Behaviour Infractions
ozfortress polices player behaviour using a system of infraction points. Infractions are split into different tiers, of which each tier carries more severe point totals and expiration times. Each person starts with 0 infraction points.

Bans will be issued at different point thresholds, and carry different ban lengths depending on which threshold is reached. Infractions are active from their issue date (seen on your profile), not from when a report is submitted or reviewed.

### Infraction Threshold Bans
Bans are issued at different point thresholds, and carry different ban lengths depending on how many points a person has accrued. [Infraction Threshold bans](/info/bans/#infraction-threshold-bans) and each ban level can be seen [below](/rules/infractions/#infraction-threshold-ban-levels).

An Infraction Threshold ban restricts and/or removes a person from all official ozfortress mediums, including the ozfortress Discord and website. Infraction Threshold bans prevent offenders from participating in any ozfortress competitions for the duration of their ban. Those serving these bans will be muted on ozfortress servers. In the event that a person reoffends during their ban period, they will be subject to a [Ban Reset](/rules/infractions/#ban-resets).

Infractions themselves are considered warnings, and as such there are no warnings for offences listed below.

## Report Requirements
- Evidence submitted via Reports should be uploaded/hosted on services where the evidence will not expire. If you wish to free up storage wherever it is located, please check with the Behaviour Panel to ensure a copy has been made.
- For reports made with evidence where it could be difficult for us to verify a person's voice, the authenticity of an account, or the context around a screenshot of a message - we ask that your submission includes proof to support that evidence, for example:
    - If you have included clips of a person speaking via voice chat, screenshots of a message/messages or other evidence that could be difficult to verify without knowing the account, please provide proof showing the authenticity of the account.
        - Some ways of doing so would be to show the account that is speaking in the video recording, including logs.tf links if it happened during a game, or the server reservation ID so it can be followed up on.

### Making a Report
If you want to learn how to make a report, please see our Support & Reporting Hub, linked below.

## Evidence Expiry Window
We observe a 6-month "statute of limitations" for all evidence submitted via reports. There are a few reasons we observe this reporting window, but chief among them is to allow players to improve upon their behaviour without late intervention. We believe everyone deserves the opportunity to change, and by enforcing this 6-month reporting window, we prevent any form of malicious reporting. In rare circumstances, typically due to the severity of the offence, we may make an exception to this rule. However, these exceptions are exceedingly rare. Simply put, we will very rarely accept reports containing evidence over 6 months in age.

## Infraction Threshold Ban Levels
+ 30 points = 3-Round Match Ban
+ 60 points = 1-Year Infraction Threshold Ban
+ 90 points = 2-Year Infraction Threshold Ban

Whilst we don't list it above, every 30 points above 90 is another year added to the ban.

!!! warning "Recent Change"
    The 3-Round Match Ban was recently lowered from 40 points, read our news post [here](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/1230) for more information.

#### 3-Round Match Ban
The 3-Round Match Ban carries across competitions, so if it is received during the offseason or at the end of your season, it will continue at the start of the next regular season or competition you play.

#### Infraction Point Expiry & Bans
Infraction points do **not** expire after a person's ban ends, Infraction points expire depending on their own expiry. Infraction expiries are listed with the offences below.

## Probations
Probations are applied when a person is banned, and said probation will remain for a 12-month period after the ban's expiry. Within this probation period, offences carry higher severity depending on the tier of the offence.

+ Tier 1 infractions are multiplied by 2x, and will incur 20 points. 
+ Tier 2 infractions are multiplied by 1.5x, and will incur 30 points.
+ Tier 3 infractions are multiplied by 2x, and will instantly incur 60 points.

## Ban Resets
Infractions accrued whilst serving a ban can result in a person's ban being reset back to its original length. We have set point thresholds to dictate when a ban will be reset, or when a person has too many points for their ban to be reset and a Ban Extension may be considered.

- Minimum Ban Reset point threshold: 30 points
- Maximum Ban Reset point threshold: 90 points

The Ban Reset thresholds are not subject to the increased penalties of Probations. The Behaviour Panel reserves the right to reset a person's ban for any offence.

### Ban Extensions
Whilst Ban Extensions have been mostly retired by Ban Resets, the Behaviour Panel will still reserve the right to use Ban Extensions in more severe cases, or where someone breaches the maximum point threshold for a Ban Reset.

!!! warning "Recent Change"
    In the past, Infractions accrued during an active ban would be upped in severity due to Probations as detailed above. With these higher penalties, offenders could see ban extensions of two years or higher. Whilst not all would believe it, we don't want to be banning anyone for periods of longer than two years, it just doesn't allow those people to reflect, change and then return. In the spirit of this, we have set a point threshold for those serving bans and if it is breached, their ban is reset back to the length their ban was previously.

## Player Behaviour Infractions
Specifically player behaviour not related to in-match play or organisation. Please note that something a player says in match communications can be subject to Behavioural Infractions.

## League Infractions

!!! warning "Recent Change"
    **League Infractions have been retired** in favour of [League Penalties](/rules/penalties). League Penalties will not contribute to infraction point totals or thresholds like its predecessor, and will also function differently to League Infractions. There are new infractions listed in the lists below, these will be added to League Penalties as well.

Poor organisation, failure to follow format rulesets.

#### Tier 1 Offences - 10 points (6 months expiry)
+ Repeated delays in Match Organisation, this can include:
    + Failing to schedule the match time/day multiple times
    + Failing to post necessary match details multiple times (ie. logs, mercenaries)
    + Failing to complete Playoff match Pick/Bans 24 hours prior to the scheduled match time/day
+ Repeated inappropriate or unrelated posting in Match Threads, specifically Match Communications, under the following conditions:
    + Any inappropriate or unrelated post made **during the organisation of a match**, meaning from attempting to organise a time/day to confirming the match scores and posting other details, will be actionable and will be deleted. On the third instance of this behaviour from a specific player, they will be infracted.
    + Any inappropriate or unrelated post made after a match has concluded and all organisational details are present will not be actionable, unless it violates our [Community Guidelines](/docs/rules/community_guidelines) or our Behavioural Infractions.
+ Failure to receive permission from team captains to cast an ozfortress official match.
> Please note that this infraction does not apply to approved casting organizations, as they do not need to seek permission.

+ Interference with an ozfortress match
+ Disbanding an in-season active roster
+ Destructive server administration / abuse of server remote control
+ Destructive in-game play - *including but not limited to*:
