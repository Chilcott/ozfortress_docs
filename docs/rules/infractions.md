ozfortress enforces its Community Guidelines along with its Global, Sixes, Highlander and other competitive rulesets using a system of infraction points. You are issued infraction points that correspond to specific rule breaches and carry different points and expiration times. Each player starts with 0 infraction points.

Bans will be issued at different point levels, and carry different ban lengths and game bans depending on how many points you have accrued. Additionally, we list the infractions that can be issued and their corresponding rule. Infractions are active from their issue date (which can be seen on your profile), not from when a report is made.

A Community Ban restricts the player’s usage of all official ozfortress mediums including the ozfortress Discord and website. A Competitive Ban prevents the player from participating in any ozfortress leagues and competitions. Players serving bans will be blacklisted from all ozfortress servers and have their ozfortress.com accounts suspended for the duration of the ban. In the event that a player reoffends during their ban period, the additional penalty will be applied with consideration for time served.

Infractions themselves are considered warnings, and as such there are no warnings for offences listed here.

The Infraction team reserves the right to infract or ban players based on the offence, including offences committed whilst that player is already serving an infraction and/or ban.

#### Important Note
Evidence submitted via Reports should be uploaded/hosted on services where the evidence will not expire. If you wish to free up storage wherever it is located, please check with the Behaviour Team to ensure a copy has been made.

## Ban Levels
+ 40 points = 3 round match ban
+ 60 points = 1 year Community and Competitive Ban
+ 90 points = 2 year Community and Competitive Ban

The 3 round match ban carries across from the offseason, so if it is received during the offseason, it will begin at the start of the next regular season for rounds one, two & three.

Infraction points do **not** expire after a user is banned. If a user receives a one-year ban involving a Tier 3 infraction, the infraction will still remain for the remainder of the two-year expiry after the player’s one-year ban has been served.

## Infraction Evidence Expiry Window
We observe a 6-month "statute of limitations" for all evidence submitted via reports. There are a few reasons we observe this reporting window, but chief among them is to allow players to improve upon their behaviour without late intervention. We believe everyone deserves the opportunity to change, and by enforcing this 6-month reporting window, we prevent any form of malicious reporting. In rare circumstances, typically due to the severity of the offence, we may make an exception to this rule. However, these exceptions are exceedingly rare.

## Behavioural Infractions
Specifically player behaviour not related to in-match play or organisation.

#### Tier 1 Offences - 10 points (6 months expiry)
+ Excessive trash talk (beyond that which can reasonably be considered banter)

#### Tier 2 Offences - 20 points (1-year expiry)

+ Attempting to deceive community members by impersonating a member of ozfortress staff
+ Serious or repeated abuse and/or harassment of any kind, including but not limited to;

+ Sharing personal, identifiable information without permission/consent from that individual. Sharing of personal/identifiable information sourced from outside of what is considered our community and/or the Team Fortress space;
    - An individual’s personal social media is under assumed privacy and anonymity; and therefore is something we consider outside of our community *unless* voluntarily shared by the individual.

+ Discrimination of any kind; some examples are;
    - Homophobia
    - Racism (ethnic or cultural)

    + Failing to complete Playoff match Pick/Bans 24 hours prior to the scheduled match time/day
+ Repeated inappropriate or unrelated posting in Match Threads, specifically Match Communications, under the following conditions:
    + Any inappropriate or unrelated post made **during the organisation of a match**, meaning from attempting to organise a time/day to confirming the match scores and posting other details, will be actionable and will be deleted. On the third instance of this behaviour from a specific player, they will be infracted.
    + Any inappropriate or unrelated post made after a match has concluded and all organisational details are present will not be actionable, unless it violates our [Community Guidelines](/docs/rules/community_guidelines) or our Behavioural Infractions.

#### Tier 2 Offences - 20 points (1-year expiry)

#### Tier 3 Offences - 30 points (2-year expiry)
None currently.

## Ban Probations
Players who have served their ban will automatically have a 12 month probation period applied. Within this period, offences carry higher points and more severe penalties. All typical Ban Levels are observed by these probationary changes, as such 60 points will instantly incur a 1 Year Competitive and Community Ban.

The differences for those serving probations are outlined below:

+ Tier 1 infractions are doubled, and will incur 20 points. 
+ Tier 2 infractions are multiplied by 1.5x, and will incur 30 points.
+ Tier 3 infractions are doubled, and will instantly incur 60 points.
