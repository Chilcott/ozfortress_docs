# Ultiduo Ruleset
This ruleset was made for Ultiduo 18/future Ultiduo competitions run by ozfortress.

## Format Specificity
Rules within this ruleset apply explicitly to ozfortress Ultiduo competitions.

## 1. Ultiduo Format
### 1.1. Class Limits
The following class limits are expected to be observed for official matches. Breaking these limits in any way is considered cheating, and depending on administrator discretion could lead to league penalties or a match result being overturned.

#### 1.1.1. Core Class Limits
- 1 Soldier
- 1 Medic

### 1.2. Whitelist (Unlocks)
The Ultiduo whitelist can be found [here](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_ultiduo).

Failure to observe weapon whitelisting will result in league penalties. For Ultiduo, the following weapons are allowed (please note only two classes can be played):

- **Soldier**
    - Rocket Launcher & Rocket Launcher Reskins
    - Shovel & Stock Melee/Reskins
    - Escape Plan
- **Medic**
    - Syringe Gun & Syringe Gun Reskins
    - Crusader's Crossbow

### 1.3. Map Scoring
In Ultiduo, all maps are King of the Hill (KOTH) maps, and follow a best of one win condition with a five minute team clock. Different KOTH maps may vary slightly on overtime timers, locked and unlocked timers (when the point is not able to be captured at the start and when it unlocks) as these are built into the map.

## 2. Ultiduo Playoffs
### 2.1. Playoff Match Format
Playoff matches are almost exclusively played as a best of three (BO3) series with maps selected from the map pool.

### 2.2. Playoff Map Selection Order
#### 2.2.1. Best of Three Playoff Matches
For playoff matches following a best of three (BO3) format, the **higher seeded team** is awarded a map pick advantage prior to bans.
