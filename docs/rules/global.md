# Global Ruleset

!!! warning "Please Note/Disclaimer"
    The following ruleset outlines the organisation and guidelines that players will need to follow for all ozfortress seasonal leagues, tournaments and competitions. Please have a good working understanding of these rules before entering yourself into the competition.

    The purpose of this global ruleset is to collate rule clauses that are typically used for all competitions and are considered by league administration as universal.
    
    We will endeavour to let players know of any changes through a front-page news post.

    Ignorance of clauses within this ruleset is not an excuse.

    **ozfortress is not affiliated with or sponsored by Valve Corporation.**

## Format Specificity
Rules within this Global ruleset that do not specify Sixes or Highlander should be taken at face value as general competitive rules. In any instance where a rule is specifically for either format, we have made sure to specify it as such. There are specific Sixes and Highlander rulesets within our rulesets which contain rules specifically for that format, be it play style, class limits, whitelists, map pools, format specific gamemode rules (eg. 5CP for Sixes, Stopwatch for Highlander) and more specific information on Tiebreakers within the league tables.

## 1. Seasonal Leagues
### 1.1. Regular Season
Regular seasons are split into skill brackets (referred to as divisions) depending on the number of teams that sign up, the format itself, and length of the competition.

For regular season length, further information on the bracket systems used & Weekly Fixtures, see each formats respective ruleset for more information:

- [Sixes](/rules/sixes/#1-regular-season)
- [Highlander](/rules/highlander/#1-regular-season)

### 1.2. Playoffs Format
At the conclusion of the regular season, the top four placing teams of each division advance to the playoffs.

Playoff matches will each be a best of three (Best of 3) map scenario, with the exception of the Sixes Premier Grand Final Grand Final, which is played as a five (Best of 5) map scenario.

Playoffs for all divisions and seasonal league formats will be run  using the [Page playoff system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system).

!!! Note "Please Note"
    Some teams will play more matches than others in Page Playoffs (traditionally only the team that wins Upper Page and proceeds to the Grand Finals will play less), meaning the ladder on the league page may not properly represent the order, but match generation is based off a team's progress through Page Playoffs, rather than ladder order.

#### Page Playoffs
In the Upper Page Playoff, the first and second-placed teams will play against each other. The winner advances directly to the Grand Final.

In the Lower Page Playoff, the third and fourth-placed teams will play against each other. The loser is eliminated.

The loser of the Upper Page Playoff will compete with the winner of the Lower Page Playoff in the Semi-Final. The loser of the Semi-Final will receive Third Place and the winner will advance to the Grand Final.

There is no Bronze/Third place decider Match.

### 1.3. Fixtures
Regular season match fixtures will be posted week to week after each round has been finalised. Fixtures are set at weekly intervals, with five available and playable match days. These match days differ for Sixes and Highlander to allow league administration an appropriate amount of time for organisational responsibilities.

#### Seasonal League Scheduling

##### Sixes (6v6)
|Scheduling|Day|
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
|Playable Match days|Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday|
|Score Submission deadline|Thursday 11:59PM AEST/AEDT|

##### Highlander (HL)
|Scheduling|Day|
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
|Playable Match days|Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday & Sunday|
|Score Submission deadline|Sunday 11:59PM AEST/AEDT|

For more information on [scheduling, see 3.1. Negotiating Match Times](/rules/global/#31-negotiating-match-times). Additionally, brush up on the [organisational responsibilities of teams here](/rules/global/#32-organisational-responsibilities).

### 1.4. Round Robin
The Round Robin system ensures each team within a bracket faces each other. Round Robin is typically only possible with a specific amount of competitors, which also typically dictates the length of the competition.
[You can find more information about Round Robin here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).

### 1.5. Swiss System
The Swiss system allows many competitors to compete against each other in a relatively small number of rounds. The first round will be scheduled randomly, and each subsequent round will be generated based on the previous results of teams. Teams with the same or similar records will be paired against each other, with the likelihood of duplicate matches minimised.
[You can find more information about the Swiss System here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).

### 1.6. Match Scoring
Each regular season fixture consists of two maps; the winner of each individual map will be awarded two league points, while the loser is awarded zero. In the event of a map draw, see [Rule 1.8](/rules/sixes/#_1-8-draws).

Rankings will first be determined by these match points. If point draws exist, the following methods will be used to break them:

#### All Divisions
1. Match wins vs. Tied participants.
2. Median-Buchholz score (total).
3. Total match wins.
4. Win difference (Total points earned minus total points lost).

### 1.7. Forfeits
Forfeits within ozfortress are used when teams are unable to field a roster for any reason, when resolving disputes, or in team based punishments. 

#### 1.7.1. Claiming a Forfeit
Forfeits are most commonly seen when a team is unable to field a roster at match time, where it is expected that the team who cannot field a roster should forfeit if they cannot get substitute players or mercenaries in-game within fifteen (15) minutes of their opponent fielding a full roster. If your opponent has not fielded a roster within fifteen (15) minutes, please reach out to a League Administrator immediately. Please do not wait more than fifteen (15) minutes before reporting these disputes to a League Administrator. To claim a forfeit, you will need to have the following ready:

- A screenshot of the in-game scoreboard.
- Screenshots of any and all match-related conversations between the all involved captains.

!!! Note "Please Note"
    In most disputes, a League Administrator will ask to join the server, in which case you should be ready to send them the full server details, including a connect string.

#### 1.7.2. Exclusion Penalties
Exclusion penalties for forfeiting may apply for future ozfortress competitions. Please see [2.6. Disbanded or Removed Teams](/rules/global/#26-disbanded-or-removed-teams) for more information on disbanded and removed teams. Forfeiting a single map will result in the entire fixture being forfeited.

#### 1.7.3. Change in Team Circumstance
It is the team captain’s responsibility to contact your division's administrator as soon as possible if there is a change in circumstances that will affect your team’s ability to field a roster each round, even if it is a temporary problem.

**ANY forfeit in Playoff rounds will result in removal from the league.**

#### Total Forfeits
Each seasonal league, along with tournaments/cups have their own forfeit limit. Typically, anything that isn't a seasonal league will typically allow no forfeits at all. Below you can find the forfeit limit for Sixes and Highlander respectively.

- Sixes: A total of **one** forfeit can occur, upon a team's second forfeit, their in-season active roster will be disbanded.
- Highlander: A total of **two** forfeit can occur, upon a team's third forfeit, their in-season active roster will be disbanded.

#### Forfeit Types
##### Forfeit Win
A forfeit win will be awarded where the offending team has not made an effort to organise the match within the match organisation dates listed in this ruleset. Forfeit wins will also be considered as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match. A forfeit win will be recorded as a match win worth 4 league points. See [Rule 4.6](/rules/sixes/#_4-6-submitting-forfeit-wins) on how to submit a forfeit win.

##### Mutual Forfeit
Mutual forfeits will be applied where neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe. A mutual forfeit will be recorded as a match loss for both teams, worth 0 league points.
Mutual forfeits contribute to the 2-forfeit league removal count.

##### Technical Forfeit
A technical forfeit will be awarded in cases where situations outside the teams’ control occur, preventing both teams from playing the match, including but not limited to, Steam outages or major weather events. A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw, worth 2 league points for each team.

### 1.8. Draws
Draws on individual maps are not possible in the ozfortress ruleset, as the map will be determined by a Golden Cap, however, matches can result in a draw when each team wins one map.

### 1.9. Administrators
Administrators are responsible for the efficient running of ozfortress competitions. Each bracket will be assigned administrators who will be the first point of contact for support and any disputes. However, all administrators can assist or deliver rulings on disputes if your bracket administrator is not available. The best way to get in contact with an administrator for help resolving match disputes is via our discord's support category. You do not need to use pings there as we have notifications on.

The General Head Administrator is ultimately responsible for the general running and organization of the league.

You can see our current and active staff for all areas of ozfortress on our [staff page](/info/staff).

### 1.10. Out of Region Teams and Players
ozfortress primarily caters to players from Australia and New Zealand, however, players from other areas such as Asia are welcome to compete. Foreign players must still play on Australian servers.

Teams outside of our supported regions are able within ozfortress seasonal leagues provided their entire roster meets the requirements or expectations outlined in our [Ping Limiting](/rules/global/#23-out-of-region-play-ping-eligibility) rule. We will work with you to ensure all players on your roster are within this limit, allowing for players to be swapped out if they are not within the limit.

Further information on the out of region player limit per roster can be found in each format's own ruleset, linked below.

- [Sixes](/rules/sixes/#212-out-of-region-player-limit)
- [Highlander](/rules/highlander/#212-out-of-region-player-limit)

### 1.11. Sportsmanship
Teams participating are required to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner in all communications.

Global chat is not fully restricted and may be used for light, friendly and tasteful banter. However, at the request of either team captain or an ozfortress administrator, chat may be restricted to only essential match communication. This request must be clearly stated in the global chat or the match communications.

Discrimination on the basis of, but not limited to, race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, or age will be regarded as an extreme breach of sportsmanship.

Breach of the sportsmanship clause will result in exclusion penalties to be determined by ozfortress administration and/or the Behaviour Panel.

### 1.12. Match Throwing
Match Throwing is punishable within ozfortress. We enforce this clause to ensure integrity in match play for all involved, and this clause directly ties in with our Tier 2 infraction for *Destructive in-game play*.

What we consider Match Throwing:

- Not actively participating in the match/map within the match.
- Not actively engaging, fighting or otherwise participating in fights against enemy players.
- Purposefully detracting from the objective of the format.
- Actively "feeding" or throwing away your life to hamper the performance of your team.

What we do not consider Match Throwing:

- Poor individual performance / statistics within a map of the match, or the entire match (unless a pattern of this behaviour has been established throughout multiple matches of a season, typically with further evidence of wrong-doing).

It should be noted that any or all of the descriptions above, are applied purely at the discretion of the administrator handling the dispute, or the wider staff team. For example in most cases, a team member who is actively working against their team by "feeding" or otherwise throwing their life away to hamper their team's performance, will see no penalty from this clause, as this is considered an internal team issue, and has little to no impact on the opposing team or the integrity of the match as a whole.

### 1.13. Match Fixing
Similar to Match Throwing found above in 1.12. Match Throwing, Match Fixing detracts from the integrity of match play and is considered punishable by ozfortress staff. However, Match Fixing differs from Match Throwing in a few ways. Match Fixing typically involves premeditation, planning or communication with another team/other teams, a third party, etc. Any attempt to detract from the integrity of match play, monetary or otherwise will be reviewed and punished at the discretion of the ozfortress staff team.

### 1.14. Game Client Updates
Whilst rare, Team Fortress 2 updates can, and have caused issues with matches; specifically using unlocks, effectively operating the official match server, or even connecting to the server. Whilst these are extreme examples, they have happened in the past, justifying the need for a basic set of guidelines to follow in the event of your match being compromised in some way by a Game Client update. 

If or when there is an issue affecting your official match where there isn't an already advised solution for already, please reach out to a League Administrator immediately for potential remedies. 

In the event that your match cannot be played due to an issue, a League Administrator will help you reschedule your official match.

---

## 2. Teams
### 2.1. Application
Teams apply to enter the whichever league/competition, and nominate their desired divisions. The minimum and maximum roster requirements/limits can be found below, along with roster expectations. It is required that your team is available to play at least three days out of the five playable match days, teams with more availability will be preferred when an administrator is resolving scheduling disputes.

**Players cannot be transferred between the end of signups and the start of the first Transfer Window.**

#### 2.1.1. Higher Division Players
Players who have played in higher divisions than their team has applied for shall be reviewed by administrators prior to transfer into their team, or their teams division seeding. These players may be restricted from specific classes if a) if they wish to play in lower divisions, or b) league administration, along with the seedings and transfer teams decide to restrict the player based on performance metrics, game knowledge, potential out-of-region ping advantage, etc.

### 2.2. Player Eligibility
**To be eligible to be accepted onto a team’s roster, a player must:**

- Have an ozfortress.com account.
- Have a minimum of 500 hours, or be verified by contacting an ozfortress administrator via our support category.
- Not be under any current competition exclusion penalties, for example:
    - League bans
    - Infraction threshold bans
    - Anti-Cheat bans
    - VAC bans
- Be eligible for play under our Out of Region Ping Eligibility clause below in 2.3.

#### 2.2.1. Game Client Eligibility
On top of [2.2. Player Eligibility](/rules/global/#22-player-eligibility), all players playing in ozfortress competitions need to be observing the following requirements:

- A maximum interpolation value either at the default `0.100ms` that ships with the game or lower. Any value above the default interpolation value is considered an exploit. See [the prohibited Game Modifications section](/rules/global/#some-examples-of-prohibited-game-modification) for more information.

### 2.3. Out of Region Play & Ping Eligibility
##### Criteria
Whether you are intending to join a roster, or play in place of an unavailable player as a mercenary, you must meet the criteria below.

- Be within 150-210 ping in-game.
- Be in good standing with the league in your region.
    - This means no league bans in your own region, be it:
        - Anti-Cheat
        - Behavioural
        - Alternate Account usage or Account Sharing

!!! Note "Please Note"
    Mercenaries are not eligible for the exceptions below.
##### What are the exceptions?

- Any out-of-region player who has been rostered on a team prior to this change, for at minimum two seasons, or has participated in 10 matches, will be eligible for play without ping testing.
- Out-of-region players who can prove their connection is consistent/stable and within acceptable tolerance (within the 150-210 range) who have previously played ozfortress before, but are under the minimum threshold for the first exception listed, will be eligible after ping testing.
- Any out-of-region player who has not previously participated in ozfortress is still eligible for play, provided their ping falls within the 150-210 ping range.

##### Who is ineligible for the above criteria/exceptions?

- Any out-of-region player whose ping is above 210, unless they meet criteria/exception #1.
- Anyone who does not meet the criteria/exceptions.

##### How does the ping testing work?

We'll keep that one close to the chest for now as we are looking to limit any potential abuse of this system, however, the process involves reaching out to the admin team, or the admin team reaching out to you during signups/seedings periods (if and only if you don't already meet the criteria or are known to meet the exceptions). We have a few methods of testing player ping and can check ping history with our server partners.

### 2.4. Captains
Team must nominate a player to act as a captain to represent the team in organising matches and liaising with ozfortress administrators. This player(s) has the ultimate responsibility for their team. If the primary captain for the team is unavailable, that captain and team is expected to nominate another captain for their roster. **Each team needs a minimum of two total captains at all times** within the season. Captains may be excluded from acting as team captains for future competitions if ozfortress administrators consider them to be unfit to lead.

### 2.5. Mutiny Rule
A simple majority of registered team members may elect to nominate a new captain or remove a captain entirely, at any point of the season. To start this process, a designated member of the team should contact their division administrator to begin this process. This may be used when a captain is the sole reason for an imminent disbanding of a team. In this situation, the team at large will remain without penalty.

### 2.6. Disbanded or Removed Teams
The captain of a disbanded or removed team will receive a tier two infraction, and all players on the Active Roster will be excluded from play for the remainder of that season. Administrators will subject future applications from a disbanded or removed team to a closer review. In some instances, players may be banned from captaining teams in the future.

To avoid penalty, captains and/or team members should approach administrators at the first sign of trouble to determine a solution.

### 2.7. Transfers
Teams may transfer players on a weekly/fortnightly basis depending on the seasonal league/competition. The transfer application must be submitted by the deadline to be eligible for play in the following window. View how to apply for a transfer [here](/rules/transfers).

##### 2.7.1. Roster Limit
Teams will only be able to increase the size of their roster throughout the season to the roster limit. Teams may not increase their roster size through transfers unless enough players have been transferred out of their team to keep their roster size under or at the roster limit.

You can find the minimum and maximum roster sizes/limits for each seasonal league below:

- [Sixes](/rules/sixes/#211-roster-size-requirementslimits)
- [Highlander](/rules/highlander/#211-roster-size-requirementslimits)

##### 2.7.2. Roster Lock
Typically one round away from the end of the Regular Season and after the last Transfer Window, Roster Lock will come into effect. Roster Lock prevents teams from removing anyone from their roster, or making any further changes outside of an [Emergency Transfer](/rules/global/#273-emergency-transfers).

For the Transfer Windows and Roster Lock dates, please see the linked Transfers page on your seasonal league or competition.

##### 2.7.3. Transfer Window Limits
Each Transfer Window has a limit for the amount of players that can be transferred in. This limit differs depending on the seasonal league or competition, but the limits for seasonal leagues can be found on the linked rulesets below. Other competitions will typically state this limit if there is one. There is no limit on the amount of players that can be transferred out of a roster.

Administrators reserve the right to deny transfer applications based on numerous factors, and judgement will adapt with each Transfer Window. Players serving exclusion penalties in ozfortress will not be eligible for transfers until after their exclusion penalty has finished. Transfers should be approved no later than two days after the end of a match week (or fortnight for Sixes).
Please note, each individual seasonal league or competition may have its own transfer rules, for example Sixes uses a two week window, where as Highlander uses a one week window. You can find specific transfer rules in each ruleset:

- [Sixes](/rules/sixes/)
- [Highlander](/rules/highlander/)

### 2.7.4. Active Roster
The Active Roster contains each and every player you count as a core or substitute player and can be used throughout the season. Players need to be requested to be transferred from the Player Pool to the Active Roster prior to their usage in an official match, otherwise, they will be counted as mercenaries.

### 2.7.5. Player Pool
The Player Pool is the area of each team where players invited to the team are listed publically. Players within the Player Pool that are not on the Active Roster are counted as Mercenaries.

### 2.7.6. Emergency Transfers
Emergency Transfers are granted by the staff team for situations where teams have an unavoidable player loss on their roster. The number of players granted and conditions are heavily case-by-case and up to the discretion of the staff team. The best way to request this process is via our support bot Alfred, as the entire staff team will immediately be able to see the request, but you can message your division or region administrator if need be.

### 2.8. Exclusions
Exclusions will be applied for repeated major rule breaches by a player or team. An exclusion will result in the immediate ejection of the player or team from the league, with potential prohibitions from playing in future competitions. In serious cases, exclusions may apply for first offences. Players/Teams can incur exclusions through our Infractions system as well, [which can be viewed here](https://docs.ozfortress.com/rules/infractions/).

### 2.9. In-Game Medals
**The sale of in-game ozfortress medals (and any other medals) is strictly PROHIBITED.**

**Valve has a strict policy that league and tournament runners do not sell Medals/Promotional items** for any currency (in-game, monetary or otherwise), and this policy is also passed on to those who wish to receive said Medals/Promotional Items (meaning you, the player). 

Selling a slot on an active roster for in-game items or money is also **strictly prohibited**.

Individuals or parties caught selling/trading for medals will be reported directly to Valve.

---

## 3. Match Organisation
### 3.1. Negotiating Match Times
Each team must select a minimum of three days in which they are able to play. Captains may change your team’s availability on a week-to-week basis, which can be edited by clicking Manage on an Active Roster, found on the team's public page. You can also see both teams' availability on the match page. Once the match for the round has been posted, teams can begin negotiating to arrange a time and date for their match. If a match time has not been negotiated between the teams, the earliest matching day from both teams’ selections will be appointed as the default date. However, this default date can be changed under the agreement of both teams.

In addition to official match days, there are also official match times. These times are 8PM, 8:30PM & 9PM Melbourne/Sydney time (AEST/AEDT). Teams that can make this time will be looked upon more favourably than teams that can not. In the event of disputes, all teams involved are expected to be able to play any of the times above. Please note, when **AEDT/Daylight Savings Time** is active, teams are required to schedule using it.

It is expected that team captains or a nominated team member make a reasonable effort to organise their match before the organisation deadline. Team members who facetiously propose match times will be punished.

Communications in match threads are considered the authoritative log for all correspondence about match organisation. Teams may decide to (and are encouraged to) negotiate the match over Steam chat or other means, however, we recommend posting chat logs in the thread to prove that such correspondence has taken place in case of a dispute.

The negotiated time must always be posted in the thread.

If it is proving difficult to get in contact with the other team, or they are not making a reasonable effort to organise the match, please bring it to the attention of your bracket’s administrator immediately.

Teams may request an extension for a playoff match through their bracket’s administrator. If an extension is granted, both teams must agree on a date within the allocated time. Opposing teams are not obligated to play within the extended period although compromise and sportsmanship between teams is encouraged.

### 3.1.1. Match Communications
Match Communications are used to discuss the essential details for official ozfortress matches. It is expected that for the duration of discussion around an official match, teams and by extension players, do not post anything non-essential to the flow of the match.

The following should be present within all Match Communications:

+ Match date/day & times, or negotiation of such.
+ Any and all mercenary requests, along with approval of mercenaries.
+ logs.tf links for each map played.
+ Anything else that teams deem essential to the correct running of their official match.

### 3.2. Organisational Responsibilities
The responsibility for these tasks falls upon the team captain of each team. If they are unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, they must nominate another team member to ensure their completion. All Official Matches need either a Captain or Nominated Player to act in a captain capacity for the duration of the match, this ensures each match runs as smoothly as possible.

##### Both teams must
+ Make an appropriate effort to organise the match.
+ Ensure attendance at the match.
+ Inform, and seek approval from the other team of any mercenaries and post their ozfortress.com profile and known applications in the match thread.
+ Inform administrators of any potential issues with the match, or of any disputes.
+ Submit or verify the final score prior to the score submission deadline.

##### The Home team must
+ Organise the game server.
+ Appropriately administer the server during the match.

##### Score Submission
**Teams must clearly state both the winner and match score of each map**. [logs.tf](https://logs.tf) links must also be linked. [more.tf](https://more.tf) and [trends.tf](https://trends.tf) links are not sufficient substitutes.

!!!tip "Example"
    cp_granary_pro: 4-1 Jasmine Tea logs.tf/xxxxxx

In the event your server cannot not upload the logs.tf log for any reason, download and upload the log file manually (if you are the server owner) or take a screenshot of the score for that map. If neither are possible, player POV demos from each team will need to be provided to administrators to prove match results.

### 3.3. Mercenaries
##### 3.3.1. Mercenary Validity & Requirements
A mercenary is a player not rostered on either team that is used in lieu of an unavailable team member. To be valid, mercenaries must have an ozfortress.com account, be within 150 ping as outlined in [2.3. Out of Region Play & Ping Eligibility](/rules/global/#23-out-of-region-play-ping-eligibility) and not be under any exclusion penalties.

Only a certain amount of mercenaries per team are allowed in each match at any moment in time, please see the links below which lead to each format's maximum amount of mercenaries.

- [Sixes Mercenary Limit - 2.2. Mercenary Limits](/rules/sixes/#22-mercenary-limits)
- [Highlander Mercenary Limit - 2.2. Mercenary Limits](/rules/highlander/#22-mercenary-limits)

##### 3.3.2. Mercenary Swaps
Teams are allowed to swap mercenaries during the match provided the other team approves the new mercenary. 

##### 3.3.3. Mercenary Limiting
Teams can only make use of of the same mercenary within **two matches per season**, this is so the same mercenary cannot be used for more than a third of the season. There is **no limit** on the amount of mercenaries used per season, only on one specific player.

##### 3.3.4. Mercenary Negotiation
Mercenaries may only be used at the **discretion of the opposing team captain**. There is no restriction on mercenary use if allowed by the opposing team captain. Do be aware that it is unlikely that opposing team captains will allow players of significantly larger skill to participate in the match and therefore reasonable requests are preferred. Team **captains do have the right to deny any mercenary**, even if they are from a lower bracket. However, **please do try to accommodate reasonable mercenary use**, as you may find yourself in the same position. We recommend contacting an administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the potential mercenary.

##### 3.3.5. Mercenary Class Locking
When mercenaries are being requested, **teams have the option to request them on a specific class**, **or to be locked to a specific class or classes**. This would then lock them to that class during that match (with the exception of reasonable off-classes; Sniper, Engineer, Pyro & Spy - these must be explicitly stated as locked when locking a player). **Teams can also request a mercenary without specifying a class**, allowing the mercenary to change classes at will if approved and if there is no agreement to lock said mercenary to a specific class or classes. **It is important to note that unless mercenaries have been explicitly "class locked"**, **they are allowed to play any class of their choosing**. **If both teams agree to a request to lock a mercenary to a specific class or classes**, **this needs to be stated in Match Communications**.

##### 3.3.6. Mercenary Manipulation & Excessive Unreasonable Mercenary Denials
Manipulating other teams into allowing mercenaries is an infractable offence (e.g. If you allow us to use a high *Premier* player we will allow you to use a low *Open* player). ozfortress administrators will judge these messages literally, and will not consider any message as a joke - all mercenary requests should be serious.

ozfortress administrators will act as arbitrators in such a case of unreasonable mercenary denial and may decide to overrule a team captain’s decision and allow a mercenary of a reasonable skill level.

##### 3.3.7. Mercenary Match Communications Requirements
Mercenary use **must be clearly stated** in the **match thread** where they are used. The information provided must include their SteamID and link to their ozfortress.com profile.

##### 3.3.8. Mercenary Player Verification
Use the [ozfortress Roster Verification Tool](https://verify.ozfortress.com/) to quickly verify all players prior to a match. To use the verifier, simply insert the status output from the console of the current match as well as the match link or ID. The tool will process your inputs and validate all players, displaying any inconsistencies with rosters.

### 3.4. Map Selection
Regular season matches will use two predefined maps from the map pool. The map pool consists of nine (9) maps, decided using data from seasonal polls.

Maps for Playoff matches are selected by the captains of each team. **This process must be completed 24 hours prior to the agreed upon match time**.

Pick/Ban order can be found on each formats ruleset, or below:

- [Sixes Pick/Ban Process](/rules/sixes/#121-playoffs-map-selection-pickbans)
- [Highlander Pick/Ban Process](/rules/highlander/#121-playoffs-map-selection-pickbans)

#### 3.4.1. Team Starting Side
In Regular Season matches, the Away team will decide which team colour they want to play. In Sixes and formats other than Highlander, this is typically only placebo (ie. Product roleouts, soldiers prefer rolling out with right handed rocket jumps as opposed to left).

In Playoff matches, the team that did not choose the map will pick their team colour. This is in an attempt to make Playoff matches as fair as possible.

### 3.5. Match Disputes
To lodge a dispute or report misconduct within a match, please contact an ozfortress administrator as soon as possible. Please do not bring the debate to the public as it is being resolved.

### 3.6. Fakenicking / Aliasing
Fakenicking / Aliasing is allowed in ozfortress matches, but be aware that both Approved/Unapproved Casting Organisations may choose to use your ozfortress alias or most notable alias. Team organisation and sponsorship tags are allowed but must be reasonable. Players are encouraged to carefully choose their submitted roster name as name change requests are both monitored and selectively approved. Name change requests cannot include emojis, special characters, or names which breach our Community Guidelines or Infractions ruleset.

### 3.7. Default Server Location and Provider
ozfortress works with serveme.tf to host bookable/reservable game servers for competitive play. Currently, **au.serveme.tf** only supports Sydney, but this rule still applies.


For ozfortress official matches (and in case of disputes), the **official server location is Sydney**. Similarly to the default server location, ozfortress also has a default server provider, which is **au.serveme.tf servers**.

### 3.8. Server Location and Provider choice
The Home team/higher-seeded team for playoffs will be able to choose the server. The Away team/lower-seeded team can contact an administrator if they feel the server choice is malicious and in an attempt to disadvantage their team significantly. Administrators reserve the right to both overrule the decision made by the Home team, as well as deny requests for the server to be changed.

For the Regular Season, teams can discuss the server to be used with each other, but if they are unable to come to a resolution to their dispute, the default server provider/location will be used.

## 4. Match Format
### 4.1. Demo Recording
POV demo files must be recorded for all ozfortress matches and must be provided at the request of an ozfortress administrator. We recommend using the demo recording system included in TF2, which can be activated under the advanced options menu in the game settings.

Find out how to record POV demo files, along with our guidelines and penalties on our [Demo Requests FAQ](/faq/demo_requests/) page.

#### 4.1.1. POV Demo Storage Requirements
Players need to keep their personal POV Demo files for at minimum two seasons after their recorded date for the purpose of Demo Checking, outlined in [4.1.2. Demo Checking](/rules/global/#412-demo-checking). Failure to do so will result in a Fail to provide POV Demo files penalty, incurring a 2-Round Match Ban. It is the responsibility of the player to ensure that when their POV Demo files are requested, the link to the file sharing service it is hosted on cannot expire. If you are concerned about storage usage on that file sharing service, please reach out to whichever staff member requested your POV Demo files to ensure you are safe to remove them.

#### 4.1.2. Demo Checking
Demo Checking can occur in ozfortress, and is used as a tool for resolving match disputes, ensuring competitive play integrity, or as a part of Random Demo Checking. In any of these instances, failure to provide POV Demo files upon request occur penalties below based on how many existing occurences of failure to provide a player has. Purposefully providing incorrect POV Demo files will also incur the following penalties:

- First instance: Two (2) Round ban
- Second instance: Two (2) Year ban
- Further instances: Two (2) Year ban

If you are not sure how to correctly provide POV Demo files upon request, or have further questions, [please see our Demo Requests FAQ page](/faq/demo_requests/#further-questions-concerns-or-issues).

### 4.2. Spectators
The only players allowed in the server of an official match are the core players currently rostered on the active roster, but cannot be in spectator while the match is live. When substituting a player for a substitute or mercenary, the substitute or mercenary is allowed to join the server and swap with one of the other players, but the player being substituted must leave when they arrive. Administrators are allowed to remain in server spectator for any reason, unless they are rostered on either team's Active Roster. Please note, this does not include SourceTV (STV) usage.

### 4.3. Pausing
Pauses during a match are allowed for any reason teams see fit excluding the following scenario:

- Pausing after readying up and beginning the match whilst missing players, with the goal of keeping the game paused until that player arrives.

!!! Note "Please Note"
    Tactical pauses are allowed, but must still conform to our pause rules.

The match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause. Both teams must give the all-clear to unpause, which is followed by an in-built five-second countdown.

Each team is permitted two pauses per match with a combined total time limit of ten minutes. However, if captains are in agreement, the pause limit can be extended.

To pause a match, teams simply need to open their console and send the following command:
```
pause
```

The same command can be sent to unpause the match.

### 4.4. Casted Games
Official matches may be casted by organisations with the approval of the ozfortress administrators.

Casting organisation representatives may contact the ozfortress General Head Administrator to receive the ability to promote their coverage and/or become an approved casting organisation. Approval will only be granted once it is determined by ozfortress that the coverage meets approved standards.

The ozfortress approved casting organisations are as follows:
+ KritzKast
+ CappingTV

Casting organisations cannot directly influence or affect the scheduling of an official ozfortress match in any way.

### 4.4.1. Approved Casting Organisations
If your game is to be casted by an approved organisation, your team must provide to the caster(s), streamer, or organisation representative:
+ The server connect string, potentially including the RCON password (if the production team requires it, they will inform you).
+ An updated list of players and/or any mercenaries participating in the match. This must be provided at least an hour before the set match time.

The above rules apply to ozfortress-approved casting organisations only.

### 4.4.2. Unapproved Casting Organisations
Casting organisations and individuals that are not approved by ozfortress may still cast official ozfortress matches, however, approved casting organisations will have precedence. If a team captain wishes to deny such a cast, they should discuss it with an ozfortress administrator.

### 4.4.3. Player POV streaming
Broadcasts of a player’s POV outside of a casted setting where STV delay is enforced, a minimum observable delay of at least ten (10) seconds is required. We define “observable delay” as a combination of personally set stream delay (for example in OBS) and standard Twitch/YouTube streaming delay. It is the players responsibility to ensure that their own stream does not impact their team in any way, and is not something we consider an actionable offence. This means that "stream sniping" is not actionable by ozfortress, and is solely the responsibility of the person streaming.

### 4.5. ozfortress Administrators as Referees
ozfortress may sometimes require certain matches to be refereed by an ozfortress administrator. In such a case, a post will be made in the match thread indicating this, and teams will be provided with a connect string before the match. If this happens, it is no longer the home team’s responsibility to administer the server or report the scores at the end of the round. Administrators may also choose to be present on the server during playoffs matches or other important matches, and will request strings from players.

## 5. Servers
### 5.1. Server Configuration
[Instructions on how to download & install ozfortress seasonal league configs can be found here.](https://github.com/ozfortress/server-configs)

### 5.2. Preferred and Acceptable Servers
[au.serveme.tf](https://au.serveme.tf) servers are considered the standard and default for all matches. However, if both teams agree, an alternative server may be used (**Rhizome** or **Qixalite** for example). See Rule 5.3 for further details on Third-party servers.

If teams cannot agree on a server, an official ozfortress default server (**au.serveme.tf**) must be used.

Administrators reserve the right to choose which server a match may be played on.

Please note: The server's SourceTV Delay (stv_delay) MUST remain at 90 seconds or above. Dropping this during or prior to your match will incur a penalty. The same can be applied to turning off STV Map Change Protect during a casted official match.

### 5.3. Third-Party Servers
For those who wish to run their own, please see the required server configurations and plugins [here](/guides/selfmanaged_servers/).

If desired, an ozfortress administrator will review your server configs to determine if you have configured it to match-ready standard.

RCON for third-party servers must be provided to ozfortress administrators on request.

ozfortress administrators reserve the right to force a match to be played on an ozfortress default server.

### 5.4. Restrictions
Each seasonal league format has its own Class Restrictions, which can be found on those format's rulesets. These are generally a limit of how many of one class can be played within a match server or configs.

Along with the above restrictions, we also run **Player Restrictions**, where eligible players are restricted from certain classes when playing in divisions lower than their skill. Player Restrictions vary depending on the number of divisions, surrounding teams and other players. These are not the only factors but are just some that we use to inform our decision-making. Breaking these Player Restrictions will incur a 1 Round Match Ban, along with a Forfeit Win awarded to the opposing team. Please note, the forfeit loss for the team of the offending player does count towards the total forfeit limit of that format.

### 5.5. Server Interruptions
In the event of an ongoing match being interrupted, the match must be resumed from the time at which the last round was completed. Any ongoing rounds will be restarted and any rounds that were completed will remain completed.

### 5.6. Coaching
Currently, ozfortress does not allow in-official coaching via any means (for example; being in the spectator, watching a POV stream via Discord, etc). This clause does not include coaching outside of an official match, like demo reviewing for example.

## 6. Cheating, Exploits and Bans
### 6.1. Exploits
The intention of exploiting any aspect of the game for an unfair advantage, whether they are explicitly listed or not, is prohibited. We consider there to be two categories of exploits; **Game Modification exploits** and **Game Mechanic exploits**. Game Modification exploitation is the act of modifying game files (and typically bypassing sv_pure 2) to gain an unfair advantage. Game Mechanic exploitation is typically engine exploits, bugs, or abuse of unattended gameplay features that are outside the scope of competitive fairness and play.

### 6.1.1. Game Modification
This is commonly treated as akin to cheating when malicious, as it is direct game file manipulation to gain an unfair advantage. Any listed item not explicitly stated as allowed is prohibited.

#### Explicitly Prohibited Game Modification
+ Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement or engine restrictions.
  - Panic scripts.
  - Bunnyhop scripts.
  - 180-degree Charge turn scripts.
  - Other turn scripts.
+ Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay, including but not limited to interpolation switchers, hud_reloadscheme stutters, or anything that causes a networked load on other clients or your own.
+ Sound-based exploits (spy decloak modifiers, footstep modifiers, audio mixers or equalizers, etc).
+ Sniper scope transparency/removal of the sniper scope.
+ Large shadows and/or box shadows.
+ Entering the player model default pose (“civilian pose”).
+ Removal/minimization of weapon sounds or particles (eg. transparent flame particles)
+ Removing map objects/props or making them transparent.
+ Malicious use of the retry command.
+ Uber Pause bug
    - A bug where medics continue to build uber during a pause whilst healing a player. This bug should be prevented by server plugins, but in the event it does happen, both teams should be made aware and an administrator should be contacted.

#### Explicitly Allowed Game Modification

+ Custom HUDs.
+ Custom Autoexec, class configs, etc.
+ Flat textures.
+ Custom Hitsounds & Killsounds.
+ No hats/cosmetics mods.
+ No explosion smoke mods.
+ Transparent viewmodels.
+ Non-malicious weapon sound replacement, some examples are:
    - Replacing hitscan or projectile weapon sounds.
        * Note: Replacement of anything that could be deemed malicious, ie. spy watch sounds replacement is strictly prohibited.
+ Crouch jump script.
+ “C-tap” jump scripts.
+ Null-cancelling movement script.
+ Rocket jump script.
+ Mask uber script.
+ Say scripts (for example, class swap messages).
+ Loadout changing scripts.
+ Viewmodel / Crosshair switchers.
+ No explosions/particles smoke script.
+ Loadout change scripts and quick respawn scripts such as forward-spawn/backward-spawn scripts are explicity allowed since Sixes Season 37 and Highlander Season 4, even if they preserve that classes current state:
    + This includes stickybomb projectiles, a medic's current medi-gun percentage and charge, an engineers buildings, etc.

### 6.1.2. Game Mechanic Exploits
Game Mechanic exploits are typically map, client or server exploits used to gain an unfair advantage.

+ Placing the Engineer’s buildings outside of the map, in indestructible locations or anywhere where it is not visible.
+ Entering areas that are “out of bounds” or not in playable space.
+ Resupplying by using spawn regions outside of spawn bounds.
+ Exploiting the map design to enter areas that aren’t within regular bounds, for any means or use excluding Wallbugs and Edgebugs as documented in [Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits](/rules/global/#explicitly-allowed-game-mechanic-exploits).
+ Map-based exploits (water jump scoping, etc).
+ Hiding sticky grenades (AKA "stickies") or engineer buildings inside of props or geometry **where they cannot be destroyed by normal means** (any class, out of the map, etc) due to differences in their visual and physical collisions is **considered an exploit**.

#### Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits

+ Wallbugs.
+ Edgebugs.
+ C-taps.

Reports made regarding exploitation are **reviewed on a case-by-case basis**.
The lists above are not exhaustive. **If you are unsure if something is considered an exploit**, **please contact an administrator** and request a ruling be made. Usage of any banned exploit or exploit with malicious intent **will** result in punishments. Punishments will range between **3 months** to **24 months** depending on multiple factors, including but not limited to **severity**, **intent**, **maliciousness**, etc.

### 6.2. Third-Party Software
The use of any third-party addons, hooks, programs or wrappers that interact with or alter the Team Fortress 2 client, its appearance or behaviour for the purposes of gaining an unfair advantage is a bannable offence. This includes usage of such programs on alternative accounts not registered with ozfortress.

### 6.3. Malicious Server Administration
The use of any server commands, variables, or plugins for the purposes of gaining an unfair advantage or to interfere with an ozfortress match is prohibited. Once the match is underway, the server administrator must let the match run its course and not make any changes without the consent of both teams.

### 6.4. Account Sharing & Alternate Accounts
Players may only register and play in ozfortress leagues with one Steam / Warzone account. Use of alternate accounts in official matches is strictly prohibited. If a player wishes to change their registered account they must contact an ozfortress administrator, however, it is unlikely that the account will be changed without good reasoning.

Sharing your login details with a third party for use in an ozfortress match is also strictly prohibited and will result in lengthy bans for all involved parties.

!!! danger "Ban Penalty"
    Usage of **Alternate Accounts and/or Account Sharing will incur a 24-month competitive ban**. Those found helping players who are currently banned evade their ban using either an Alternate Account or sharing someone else's account will receive the same penalty.

### 6.5. ozfortress Bans
Members banned on the ozfortress website are also banned from leading teams in ozfortress competitions. Players banned from the ozfortress website may also be subject to competition bans and are considered under probation. It is standard for those serving Competitive, Anti-Cheat or Infraction Threshold to be banned from our Discord server as well as being barred from using some bookable server services. Please contact an ozfortress administrator for further clarification.

### 6.6. Match Fixing
Any attempt to influence the result of a match through any means other than standardised gameplay is strictly forbidden. If this is found to be happening, all involved parties will receive league punishments.

## 7. Ruleset Information
### 7.1. Rules are subject to change
The rules set on this page may be updated at any time. It is the responsibility of the player(s) to keep up to date with these rules. Rule changes during a season will be clearly announced with a front-page post, and changes outside of a season being relayed also via a front-page post.

### 7.2. Rulings
ozfortress reserve the right to change, modify or adapt all rules as deemed appropriate by ozfortress to uphold and maintain a spirit of overall fairness and good sportsmanship. We understand that the ruleset may not cover every situation and therefore we may occasionally deliver judgement-based rulings. We will not change, modify or adapt any clause "on the fly", and will endeavour to make the community aware of ruleset changes.
