# Global Ruleset
!!! warning "Please Note/Disclaimer"
    **ozfortress is not affiliated with or sponsored by Valve Corporation.**

    **The sale of in-game ozfortress medals, as well as any other medals, is strictly prohibited.**
    
    **Valve maintains a strict policy that league and tournament runners against the sale of Medals/Promotional items by league and tournament organizers,** and this policy extends to players seeking to acquire such Medals/Promotional Items, whether through in-game currency, real money, or other means.

    Additionally, selling a slot on an active roster for in-game items or money is also **strictly prohibited**. Individuals or parties caught engaging in the sale or trade of medals will be reported directly to Valve.

## 1. Ruleset Information
### 1.1. Global Ruleset
The purpose of this ruleset is to collate rule clauses that are typically used for all competitions and are considered by league administration as universal. It is the responsibility of each player to be informed of the contents of the current ruleset. **Ignorance of clauses within this ruleset is not an excuse.**

#### 1.1.1. Format Rulesets
Rules in this ruleset that don't mention Sixes or Highlander should be considered general competitive rules. Specific format rules, such as class limits, whitelists, map pools, and game mode rules (like 5CP for Sixes or Stopwatch for Highlander), are detailed in the [Sixes ruleset](/rules/sixes/) and the [Highlander ruleset](/rules/highlander/).

### 1.2. Ruleset Changes
ozfortress reserves the right to modify its rulesets as deemed appropriate to uphold and maintain a spirit of overall fairness and good sportsmanship. Any changes will be clearly announced through a news post on the ozfortress front page.

### 1.3. Rulings
This ruleset serves as the guideline for which rulings are made by administrators. We understand that the ruleset may not cover every situation and, therefore, we may occasionally deliver judgement-based rulings. 

### 1.4. Admin Shopping
Seeking a different answer from other administrators after receiving a ruling is strictly prohibited and may result in punishment. Teams **are** allowed, however, to appeal a decision with a more senior admin (such as a format's head admin).

### 1.5. Sportsmanship
Players and teams participating in ozfortress competitions are expected to maintain sportsmanship in all communications, with global chat allowing light and friendly banter. Discrimination based on factors such as race, nationality, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or age is considered an extreme breach of sportsmanship, resulting in penalties determined by ozfortress administration or the Behaviour Panel.

### 1.6. Staff
Currently, three distinct teams of staff support ozfortress and its competitions. You can see our current and active staff for all areas of ozfortress on our [staff page](/info/staff/).

#### 1.6.1. League Administrators
For any competition-specific issues, team captains should contact league administrators through the competition's Team Captain Discord. For all other issues, league administrators can be contacted through the #admin-support channel in the ozfortress Discord.

#### 1.6.2. Anti-Cheat
All cheating-related matters should be reported to the Anti-Cheat team. You can read more about this process [here](/info/anticheat_and_you/), as well as in [11. Cheating, Exploits and Bans](/rules/global/#11-cheating-exploits-and-bans)

#### 1.6.3. Behaviour Panel
All behaviour matters, including those covered in [1.5. Sportsmanship](/rules/global/#15-sportsmanship), should be reported to the Behaviour Panel. You can read more about this process [here](/rules/infractions/).

#### 1.6.4. ozfortress Representation
ozfortress staff may, on occasion, represent themselves using an ozfortress tag. Players not part of ozfortress staff who change their alias to contain the ozfortress tag may be infracted as outlined [here](/rules/infractions/).

---

## 2. Seasonal Leagues
### 2.1. Season Structure
ozfortress Seasonal Leagues typically run for a total of eight to ten weeks. First, a regular season is completed, followed by three weeks of playoffs.

### 2.2. Divisions
Seasonal leagues are divided into skill brackets, referred to as divisions. These divisions depend on the number of teams that sign up, the competition format, and the length of the competition. When applying to participate in competitions, teams nominate their preferred divisions. While efforts will be made to accommodate these preferences, the skill level of a team compared to others within the division may influence final division placements.

#### 2.2.1. Upper and Lower Divisions
Divisions are often grouped as the Upper and Lower divisions. There may be small format differences between Upper and Lower divisions, such as map pools or finals format. This will be communicated on the seasonal league page.

|   Format   |    Upper Divisions    |     Lower Divisions      |
| :--------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------: |
|   Sixes    |     Premier, High     | Intermediate, Main, Open |
| Highlander | Premier, Intermediate |        Main, Open        |

### 2.3. Map Pool
Each season features a pool of nine maps which are played in both regular season and playoff matches. You can find the map pool for a season on its seasonal league page.

#### 2.3.1. Upper and Lower Map Pools
Upper divisions and Lower divisions may feature different map pools. This will be communicated on the seasonal league page.

#### 2.3.2. Alternative Maps
A season may feature a tenth or eleventh map as alternative maps. This will be communicated on the seasonal league page.

In regular season matches, teams can agree to play an alternative map as a replacement for a map of the same game mode. If two teams agree to play an alternative map, **it must be posted on the match page before the match**.

In playoff matches, alternative maps will **not** be available for selection.

### 2.4. Playable Match Days
Matches can be played at any point **during** a round.

#### 2.4.1. Primary Match Days
**Primary** match days are the intended days for which matches are played.

|   Format   | Primary Match Days |
| :--------: | :----------------: |
|   Sixes    | Sunday - Thursday  |
| Highlander | Wednesday - Sunday |

#### 2.4.2. Secondary Match Days
**Secondary** match days were previously days common for extensions. Now, teams may agree to play their match on a secondary match day without administrator approval, however opposing teams are not obligated to agree to do so. 

|   Format   | Secondary Match Days |
| :--------: | :------------------: |
|   Sixes    |  Friday & Saturday   |
| Highlander |   Monday & Tuesday   |

If there are match scheduling conflicts, availability on primary match days trumps availability on secondary match days.

### 2.5. Regular Season
Rounds within a regular season are completed at weekly intervals; teams compete in one match each week featuring two maps from the map pool. These two maps are typically determined by league administration and can be found on the seasonal league page. On some occasions, certain divisions in certain competitions may employ a map selection system.

Regular seasons are typically run using Round-Robin, however, depending on signup numbers, the Swiss System may be used. The system used will be clearly stated on the seasonal league page.

#### 2.5.1. Round-Robin
The Round-Robin system guarantees that every team within a division compete against each other once. You can find more information about Round-Robin [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).

#### 2.5.2. Swiss System
The Swiss System allows a greater number of competitors to compete against each other in a smaller number of rounds. The first round is scheduled based on seedings, and subsequent rounds are generated according to previous team results, pairing teams with comparable records. You can find more information about the Swiss System [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).

#### 2.5.3. Match Scoring
During the regular season, teams compete in one match each week featuring two maps. The winner of each map will be awarded two league points, while the loser is awarded zero. Regular season matches can result in a draw when each team wins one map.

#### 2.5.4. Map Draws
Draws on individual maps are not possible in ozfortress matches.

Please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [1.3.5. 5CP map draws](/rules/sixes/#135-5cp-map-draws)
- Highlander: [1.5.4. 5CP map draws](/rules/highlander/#154-5cp-map-draws)

#### 2.5.5. League Ranking
League rankings will be initially determined by match points; in the event of point draws, tiebreakers will be applied in the following order:

1. Match wins vs. tied participants (Direct Encounter)
2. Median Buchholz
3. Total map wins
4. Win difference (Total points earned minus total points lost)

### 2.6. Playoffs
Following the conclusion of the regular season, Playoffs are played to determine the overall winner of the competition.

Typically, the top four teams in each division progress to the playoffs which adhere to the Page Playoff system. You can find more information about the Page Playoff system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system).

Please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [2. Sixes Playoffs](/rules/sixes/#2-sixes-playoffs)
- Highlander: [2. Highlander Playoffs](/rules/highlander/#2-highlander-playoffs)

#### 2.6.1. Page Playoffs

!!! warning "Please Note"
    In Page Playoffs, certain teams may participate in more matches than others. Consequently, the league standings displayed on the league page may not accurately reflect the final team placements for the season.

Page Playoffs have three rounds:

1. First round: Upper Page Playoff and Lower Page Playoff
	* In the Upper Page Playoff, the top two teams compete.
		* The winner advances to the Grand Final.
		* The loser competes in the Semi-Final.
	* In the Lower Page Playoff, the third and fourth-placed teams compete.
		* The winner advances to the Semi-Final.
		* The loser is eliminated and is awarded fourth place.
2. Semi-Final: The loser of the Upper Page Playoff and the winner Lower Page Playoff compete.
	* The winner advances to the Grand Final.
	* The loser is eliminated and is awarded third place.
3. Grand Final: The remaining two teams compete to determine the overall winner for the season.
### 2.7. Minimum Players in Matches
In matches, teams are expected to play with the required total players at all times.

|   Format   | Minimum Rostered Players | Required Total Players |
| :--------: | :----------------------: | :--------------------: |
|   Sixes    |        4 players         |       6 players        |
| Highlander |        6 players         |       9 players        |

When a team is missing rostered players, they are expected to utilise mercenaries to meet the required total players. If a team fields fewer than the required minimum rostered players, or fewer than the required total players, the opposing team will be awarded a forfeit win.

#### 2.7.1. Player Disconnects During Matches
If a player disconnects during a match, teams may elect to play with one fewer player **with admin approval**. In such instances, teams must still satisfy the required minimum rostered players.

### 2.8. Forfeits
Forfeits are employed when teams are unable to field the required number of players, during dispute resolutions, or as part of team-based punishments. Forfeiting a single map will result in the entire match being forfeited.

#### 2.8.1. Forfeit Win
Forfeit wins are most commonly awarded when a team is unable to field the required number of players at the scheduled start time of the match. In such instances, it is expected that the team unable to field the required number of players forfeit the match unless they secure substitute players or mercenaries within fifteen minutes of the scheduled start time of the match.

If your opponent has not fielded the required number of players within fifteen minutes of the scheduled start time of the match, promptly contact a League Administrator. To claim a forfeit, ensure you have the following prepared:

- a screenshot of the in-game scoreboard
- screenshots of all match-related conversations

A forfeit win may also be awarded for a variety of other reasons, including:

- when the offending team fails to make an effort to organise a match
- when the offending team fields players who exceed the [3.2.1. Ping Limit](/rules/global/#321-ping-limit)
- as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match 

A forfeit win will be recorded as a match win worth four league points.

#### 2.8.2. Mutual Forfeit
Mutual forfeits will be implemented when both teams are at fault, such as when neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe or neither team has sufficient availability to support match organisation.  

These mutual forfeits will be recorded as match losses for both teams, each worth zero league points. It's important to note that mutual forfeits contribute to a team's forfeit limit.

#### 2.8.3. Technical Forfeit
A technical forfeit will be granted in cases where circumstances beyond the teams' control hinder both teams from playing the match. This includes but is not limited to, Steam outages or major weather events.

A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw worth two league points for each team.

#### 2.8.4. Forfeit Limits
In seasonal leagues, **a maximum of one forfeit can occur**. Upon a team's second forfeit, their in-season active roster will be disbanded. Generally, non-seasonal formats such as cups do not allow any forfeits.

Please see [4.5. Disbanded Teams](/rules/global/#45-disbanded-teams) for additional information on disbanded and removed teams, including penalties for team captains and players.

#### 2.8.5. Playoffs Forfeits
**Any forfeit during Playoffs will result in immediate removal from the league and incur heavier penalties.** The remaining playoff teams below the disbanded team will move up one rank. If feasible, the playoff matches involving the disbanded team may be replayed.

#### 2.8.6. Change in Team Circumstances
The team captain must **promptly** contact a League Administrator in the event of any change in circumstance that might impact the team's ability to field a roster, even in the case of temporary issues.

#### 2.8.7. Game Client Updates
Team Fortress 2 updates can cause issues with the smooth operation of matches. If or when there is an issue affecting your official match where there isn't an already advised solution for already, please reach out to a League Administrator immediately. If your match cannot be played due to an issue, a League Administrator will help you reschedule your official match or a Technical Forfeit will be awarded.

### 2.9. Match Throwing
Match Throwing is a punishable offence in ozfortress to maintain integrity in match play. Those determined to be Match Throwing will receive a Tier 2 Infraction.

Match Throwing includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- deliberate non-participation in a match, including AFKing or idling
- deliberate lack of effort, such as adopting nonsensical team compositions or use of mercenaries far below a team's skill level
- deliberate disregard of format objectives, such as refusing to capture a point
- actively throwing one's life away to impede the performance of the team

Accusations of Match Throwing are taken seriously, and application of this clause is at the discretion of the ozfortress staff team.

#### 2.9.1. Match Fixing
Match Fixing, although similar to Match Throwing, typically involves premeditation, planning or communication with other parties. Any effort to compromise the integrity of match play, whether involving monetary incentives or otherwise, will be reviewed and punished at the discretion of the ozfortress staff team.

## 3. Player Eligibility
### 3.1. Requirements
To be eligible to play in ozfortress competitions, either as a member of a roster or as a mercenary, a player must:

- have an ozfortress.com account
- have a minimum of 500 hours, or be verified by contacting an ozfortress administrator
- not be under any current competition exclusion penalties, including:

    - league bans
    - infraction threshold bans
    - Anti-Cheat bans 
    - VAC bans

- satisfy the [3.2.1. Ping Limit](/rules/global/#321-ping-limit) or have an exception approved as outlined in [3.2.3. Exceptions](/rules/global/#323-exceptions)
- have a maximum interpolation value either at the default `0.100ms` that ships with the game or lower

    - any value above the default interpolation value is considered an exploit
    - see [11.1. Exploits](/rules/global/#111-exploits) for more information

#### 3.1.1. Player Aliases and Avatars
All player aliases and avatars (both in-game on and the ozfortress website) must be appropriate and will be contextually reviewed by ozfortress administrators. Player aliases on the ozfortress website cannot include emojis or special characters.

Player alias requests can be made through a player's ozfortress profile settings, and these requests will **not** be processed until the conclusion of any active ozfortress competition.

#### 3.1.2. Alternative Accounts
**The use of alternative accounts is strictly forbidden.** Player registration and participation in ozfortress leagues must occur exclusively through one Steam account. If a player wishes to change their registered account, they must contact an ozfortress administrator. However, it is unlikely that the account will be changed without good reasoning.

!!! danger "Ban Circumvention"
    If an alternative account is used to circumvent an existing ban, all matches they participated in during the season will be overturned and will result in harsh penalties determined by ozfortress administration.

#### 3.1.3. Team Due Diligence
When recruiting new players, captains and other team members are expected to practice due diligence to avoid penalties if an alternative account is discovered. 

Outlined below are reasonable checks players should undertake to avoid penalties:

- Be cautious of players who:
    - perform well despite lacking traceable competitive experience
    - have limited experience in TF2 or utilise newer Steam accounts
    - claim to not own a microphone

- Verify claims made by players of:
    - being a "pro" in other games
    - returning from a prolonged absence
    - moving to Australia having participated in overseas competitions

**Players should proactively inform admins of any suspicions regarding players.** Failure to perform these basic checks may result in both player and team punishments if an alternative account is discovered.

### 3.2. Out-of-Region Players
Although ozfortress is primarily an Australian and New Zealand league, players from other countries are welcomed.

#### 3.2.1. Ping Limit
Out-of-Region Players intending to join a roster, or play as a mercenary, must meet the **in-game ping limit of 180**. If you are unsure whether you meet this requirement, you should contact a league administrator to undergo a ping check. **It is the responsibility of Out-of-Region Players to ensure that they satisfy this ping limit.**

!!! warning "Ping Limit Breaches"
    In the event a match is played featuring a player who fails to meet the ping limit requirements, league administrators may penalise the offending team, including awarding a forfeit win.

#### 3.2.2. Ping Fluctuations
We understand that ping fluctuations do occur and that this can result in players experiencing far greater ping than what would normally be expected. Experiencing bad network conditions in an individual instance **does not invalidate previous ping checks**. You may, however, be requested to redemonstrate that you satisfy the ping limit by a league administrator.

#### 3.2.3. Exceptions
Some players who previously participated in our competitions may no longer meet the new limit described above. Teams hoping to roster such players should speak to a league administrator to get an exception approved. 

**Exceptions are competition-dependent. As such, teams must get exceptions re-approved for each competition.**

### 3.3. Banned Players Outside of Competitions
We understand that some banned players continue to participate in our community despite being excluded from our competitions. We do not want to unnecessarily police the involvement of such players, nor force players to exclude their friends who have made poor decisions previously. We do, however, want to discourage the involvement of those who repeatedly break our rules, even after being banned.

Below clear boundaries for the participation of such players in pugs, scrims, or any other ozfortress-adjacent activity have been outlined.

#### 3.3.1. Players Banned Due to Infractions
If a player banned for reaching the infraction limit participates in any pug or scrim and engages in conduct warranting further penalities, those responsible for that player's participation may also be penalised.

!!! warning "Common Sense Approach"
    You should only expect this rule to come into effect when players banned due to infractions brazenly reoffend.

#### 3.3.2. Players Banned for Cheating
A player banned for cheating-related offenses should not in **any** circumstance participate in pugs, scrims, or any other ozfortress-adjacent activity. Those responsible for that player's participation will be heavily penalised.

#### 3.3.3. Permanently Banned Players in Scrims
Permanently banned players should not in **any** circumstance participate in pugs, scrims, or any other ozfortress-adjacent activity. Those responsible for that player's participation will be heavily penalised.

---

### 4. Teams
### 4.1. Team Aliases and Avatars
All team aliases and avatars must be appropriate and will be contextually reviewed by ozfortress administrators. Team aliases or avatars referencing an established company or brand without explicit approval are not permitted.

#### 4.1.1. Premier Team Aliases
Premier teams will have their aliases held to a higher standard befitting the division's status as the highest level of Australian competitive play.

#### 4.1.2. Team and Sponsorship Tags
Team organisation and sponsorship tags are permitted but must be both appropriate and reasonable.

### 4.2. Team Captains
Captains have the ultimate responsibility for their team, representing them in organising matches and communicating with ozfortress administrators. In the event of any team-related offenses, captains will be held responsible and will be subject to punishment.

#### 4.2.1. Captain Requirements
**Teams must nominate two or three captains** and, if a captain is unavailable or departs a roster, the team is expected to nominate another captain. **All** team captains are required to join competition-related Discord servers as outlined in [7.2. Team Captain Discord](/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).

#### 4.2.2. Captaincy Bans
Captains who fail to fulfil their required responsibilities, particularly when it impacts other teams within their division, will receive a captaincy ban. The duration of the captaincy ban is determined by ozfortress administrators based on the specific context of the situation.

#### 4.2.3. Mutiny Rule
At any point of the season, a two-thirds majority of players on an Active Roster may elect to nominate a new captain or remove a captain entirely. To initiate this process, a team member should contact a league administrator. If necessary, emergency transfers may be granted as outlined in [5.6. Emergency Transfers](/rules/global/#56-emergency-transfers).

### 4.3. Active Roster
The Active Roster comprises all players, regardless of whether they are core or substitute players, that can be used in matches. Players not on a team's Active Roster must be approved for usage as a mercenary. To view players on the Active Roster of a competition, view the Leagues tab on a team's ozfortress profile.

To add or remove players from an Active Roster, transfers may be initiated as outlined in [5. Player Transfers](/rules/global/#5-player-transfers).

#### 4.3.1. Roster Limit
The number of players on an active roster is limited based on the format.

|   Format   |  Minimum  |  Maximum   |
| :--------: | :-------: | :--------: |
|   Sixes    | 6 players | 10 players |
| Highlander | 9 players | 15 players |

#### 4.3.2. Player Verification
If necessary, the [ozfortress Roster Verification Tool](https://verify.ozfortress.com/) may be used to quickly verify all players before a match. The tool will process your inputs and validate all players, displaying any roster inconsistencies.

### 4.4. Out-of-Region Players
There is no limit to the number of Out-of-Region players that may be on a roster. However, Out-of-Region players must satisfy the [3.2.1. Ping Limit](/rules/global/#321-ping-limit) or have an exception approved as outlined in [3.2.3. Exceptions](/rules/global/#323-exceptions).

### 4.5. Disbanded Teams
Captains of a disbanded team will receive a Tier 2 Infraction and may face a captaincy ban. Furthermore, all players on the Active Roster of a disbanded team will be barred from play for the remainder of that season. **Disbanded Teams are not awarded in-game medals.** 

To prevent penalties, team captains and/or team members are encouraged to promptly engage with administrators at the first sign of issues to work towards a solution.

### 4.6. Class Restrictions
Depending on the skill level of a player and their team, class restrictions may apply. Class restrictions are informed by many factors including, but not limited to, other teams and players within a division. As restrictions are often contextual, a player who shifts teams within a division may encounter a different set of restrictions.

#### 4.6.1. Class Restriction Limit
The number of players on a roster who can be class restricted is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Class Restriction Limit |
| :--------: | :---------------------: |
|   Sixes    |        3 players        |
| Highlander |        No limit         |

#### 4.6.2. Class Restriction Non-Compliance
If a player plays a restricted class, this player will receive a Tier 2 Infraction. Additionally, a forfeit win will be awarded to the opposing team. This forfeit loss **does** contribute to the offending team's total forfeit limit.

---

## 5. Player Transfers
Teams have the flexibility to initiate player transfers at **any point** during the **regular** season, however, these transfers are processed and approved after the conclusion of the current round.

League administrators may deny transfer requests, particularly if they violate the requirements of [4.3.1. Roster Limit](/rules/global/#431-roster-limit) or [4.6.1. Class Restriction Limit](/rules/global/#461-class-restriction-limit).

To learn more, including how to initiate a player transfer, see the [Transfers](/info/transfers/) page.

### 5.1. Inbound Transfer Limit Per Round
The number of players on a roster who can be transferred **into** a roster per **round** is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Inbound Transfer Limit Per Round |
| :--------: | :------------------------------: |
|   Sixes    |             1 player             |
| Highlander |            3 players             |

### 5.2. Inbound Transfer Limit Per Season
The number of players on a roster who can be transferred **into** a roster per **season** is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Inbound Transfer Limit Per Season |
| :--------: | :-------------------------------: |
|   Sixes    |             4 players             |
| Highlander |             6 players             |

### 5.3. Outbound Transfer Limits

### 5.4. Individual Player Transfer Limit
A player may only change rosters a maximum of two times per season.

### 5.5. Roster Lock
Before the conclusion of the regular season, teams may no longer change their roster. This information will be found on seasonal league pages.

### 5.6. Emergency Transfers
Emergency Transfers are approved by league administrators in situations where teams experience unavoidable player losses. Depending on the circumstances, an emergency transfer may be granted even if it would result in exceeding transfer limits.

If an Emergency Transfer is needed, notify your Division Administrators in the Team Captain Discord immediately.

---

## 6. Mercenaries
A mercenary is a player not rostered on a team's Active Roster that is used in place of an unavailable team member. 

### 6.1. Requirements
**All mercenaries must meet all player requirements as outlined in [3.1. Requirements](/rules/global/#31-requirements)**. This includes ping limits and not facing any exclusion penalties.

### 6.2. Mercenary Approval
Mercenaries **must be approved by a captain of the opposing team**. When requesting a mercenary, captains should provide the following information to the opposing team:

- a link to the mercenary's ozfortress profile
- which class(es) they intend for the mercenary to play
- which player the mercenary is replacing

Once a mercenary is approved, it **must** be stated in the match thread.

#### 6.2.1. Reasonable Mercenary Requests
A player who is completely unrestricted in a division below that in which a match is being played is considered a reasonable mercenary request and should be approved without any restrictions.

If a team is concerned about the impact of such a player, team captains are encouraged to contact an administrator.

#### 6.2.2. Reasonable Mercenary Denial
As there can be significant skill discrepancies within a division, **teams have the right to deny players from the same division from playing as mercenaries**.

However, **please do try to accommodate reasonable mercenary use** as you may find yourself in the same position. We recommend contacting a league administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the requested mercenary.

#### 6.2.3. Contesting Mercenary Denials
If a team captain has requested three mercenaries which they deem to be **of a reasonable level** and the opposing team has denied all three, an administrator should be contacted.

#### 6.2.4. Mercenary Manipulation
Attempting to manipulate other teams into allowing mercenaries is an infractable offence. ozfortress administrators will interpret these messages literally and will not consider any message as a joke. All mercenary requests should be made seriously and with genuine intent.

#### 6.2.5. Mercenary Class Locking
When approving a mercenary, **teams have the option to lock a mercenary to specific classes**. Unless mercenaries have been explicitly locked to a class, they can play any class of their choosing. **Any class locks placed on mercenaries must be stated in the match thread.**

In Sixes, mercenaries can also be locked from playing certain off classes as outlined in [1.1.3. Mercenary Off Class Locking](/rules/sixes/#113-mercenary-off-class-locking).

#### 6.2.6. Class Restricted Players as Mercenaries
The class restrictions of a player still apply when accepted as a mercenary. They are prohibited from playing those restricted classes in divisions below where the restriction was set.

This is also true for the division where the restriction was set. However, if an opposing team would like to ignore the class restrictions of a mercenary within their division, they can do so but **must seek administrator approval**.

Class restrictions do not apply in divisions above where the restriction was set, however such players are still subject to potential class locking as outlined in [6.2.5. Mercenary Class Locking](/rules/global/#625-mercenary-class-locking).

### 6.3. Mercenary Limits
The number of mercenaries per team allowed at any moment is limited based on the format.

|   Format   | Mercenary Limit |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|   Sixes    |  2 mercenaries  |
| Highlander |  3 mercenaries  |

### 6.4. Reusing Mercenaries
Teams can only make use of the same mercenary within **two matches per season**. There is **no limit** on the amount of mercenaries used per season, only on one specific player.

---

## 7. Match Organisation
All time scheduling is to be completed with AEST (if daylight savings is not in effect) or AEDT (if daylight savings is in effect). Times stated below do not change based on daylight savings, meaning "7PM AEST/AEDT" refers to 7PM for both AEST and AEDT.

### 7.1. Organisation Responsibility
The responsibility for all match organisation tasks falls upon the team captain of each team. If they are unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, they must nominate another team member to ensure their completion.

### 7.2. Team Captain Discord
All ozfortress competitions feature a Team Captain Discord. This Discord serves as a hub for **all** competition-related communication, including match organisation and contacting league administration. Teams should not contact league administration regarding ongoing competitions externally of this Discord, as this may be considered an instance of [1.4. Admin Shopping](/rules/global/#14-admin-shopping).

### 7.3. Match Organisation
Once the match for the round is posted on the ozfortress website, a Discord thread will be created in the Team Captain Discord. Team Captains should communicate the days and times in which they are available to play as soon as possible. Playable match days are outlined in [2.4. Playable Match Days](/rules/global/#24-playable-match-days).

We encourage all teams to set their match days and times, but in the case of a dispute an administrator may enforce the default match day and/or times.

|   Format   | Default Match Day | Default Match Times  |
| :--------: | :---------------: | :------------------: |
|   Sixes    |     Thursday      | 8PM or 9PM AEST/AEDT |
| Highlander |      Sunday       | 8PM or 9PM AEST/AEDT |

#### 7.3.1. Scheduling Issues
If the other team is not responding in the Team Captain Discord, or are not making a reasonable effort to organise the match, please ping your Division Administrators in the Team Captain Discord immediately.

#### 7.3.2. Emergency Extensions
If required, teams may seek an **emergency** extension by contacting their Division Administrators in the Team Captain Discord. Opposing teams are not obligated to accept a request for an extension, although compromise and sportsmanship between teams are encouraged. Missing core players is **not** grounds for extension; a backup player or mercenary should be used.

### 7.4. ozfortress Match Threads
Match Threads on the ozfortress website are used to communicate the essential details of matches. It is expected that until the completion of an official match, players do not post anything non-essential to the flow of the match. Doing so may result in an infraction.

#### 7.4.1. Match Thread Requirements
The following **must** be posted in the match thread by the **Home Team**:

 1. The agreed-upon day and time **immediately** after confirmation.
 2. A link to each map's logs.tf page **within 24 hours** of the match's conclusion.
 3. Any other match details **within 24 hours** of the match's conclusion.

In the event of a mercenary being required, this must be posted by the team requesting the mercenary in the match thread **prior** to the commencement of the match. This must include any class locks as described in [6.2.5. Mercenary Class Locking](/rules/global/#625-mercenary-class-locking).

#### 7.4.2. Match Log Issues
If logs are unavailable for a match, the **Home Team** must take a screenshot of the score for each map and upload these to the match thread **within 24 hours** of a match's conclusion. If this is not possible, player POV demos from each team may be requested by administrators to validate match results.

#### 7.4.3. Upper Division STV Demos
Every Upper division match must have its STV demos uploaded to the match thread by the team that provided the server **within 24 hours** of a match's conclusion. This may be done through a link to the demos.tf page, or uploaded as described in the [Demo Requests FAQ page](/faq/demo_requests/).

Failing to upload STV demos will result in the following penalties:

- first instance: warning
- second instance: Tier 1 Infraction
- all future instances: Tier 2 Infraction

### 7.5. Organisational Deadlines
For any given match, the following organisation deadlines must be observed:

|   Format   | Match date/time organised |          Match results submitted           |
| :--------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|   Sixes    |   Monday 7PM AEST/AEDT    | No later than 24 hours **after** the match |
| Highlander |  Thursday 7PM AEST/AEDT   | No later than 24 hours **after** the match |

#### 7.5.1. Upper Division Grand Finals
The Grand Finals match for Upper Divisions must be scheduled at least **four** days after the conclusion of the Lower Bracket Finals match to allow for effective promotion of the match. 

In the event that this is not possible, a league administrator should be contacted immediately.

#### 7.5.2. Reorganising Casted Matches
Matches being cast by Approved Casting Organisations must adhere to the agreed-upon match time. If rescheduling a match is necessary, this must be done **at least** twenty-four hours in advance to support the casting organisation. Repeat offenders will find themselves infracted.

### 7.6. Map Selection
Regular season matches feature two maps from the competition's map pool.

#### 7.6.1. Playoff Map Selection
For playoff matches, the selection of maps is the responsibility of the team captains. This process should be completed at least 24 hours prior to the agreed-upon match time. **In the event of a playoff match being casted, this process must be completed at least 24 hours prior.**

For map selection order, please refer to the respective ruleset for more information:

- Sixes: [2.4. Playoff Map Selection Order](/rules/sixes/#24-playoff-map-selection-order)
- Highlander: [2.2.1. Playoff Map Selection Order](/rules/highlander/#221-playoff-map-selection-order)

---

## 8. Matches
**During Playoffs, the higher-seeded team is considered the Home team.**

### 8.1. Match Servers
It is the responsibility of the Home team to organise the game server and to appropriately manage the server, including executing appropriate configs, during the match.

If there are issues with the Home team's server selection, the Away team may contact a league administrator. 

Please see [10. Servers](/rules/global/#10-servers) for more information, including the default server provider and server location.

### 8.2. Team Starting Side
In Regular Season matches, the Away team will decide which team colour they want to play. In Playoff matches, the team that did not choose the map will pick their team colour.

### 8.3. Match Disputes
To lodge a dispute or report misconduct within a match, please contact a league administrator as soon as possible. Please do not bring the debate to the public while it is being resolved.

### 8.4. ozfortress Administrators as Referees
ozfortress may require certain matches to be refereed by a League Administrator. In such instances, a post will be made in the match thread to communicate this decision.

When this occurs, the Home team is no longer responsible for the server. Instead, the League Administrator will provide both teams with a connect string before the match. 

Administrators may also choose to be present on the server during playoff matches or other important matches.

### 8.5. Fakenicking / Aliasing
Fakenicking / Aliasing is allowed in matches, but be aware that both Approved and Unapproved Casting Organisations may choose to use your ozfortress alias or most notable alias during their casts.

#### 8.5.1. Distinct Aliases
During matches, all players must have distinct aliases. Failing to do so may result in an infraction.

#### 8.5.2. Correct Aliases Upon Request
During matches cast by Approved Casting Organisations, players must run an alias matching their ozfortress profile upon request. Whilst an exact match is not required, player aliases should be immediately recognisable to casters and viewers.

### 8.6. Spectators
Players in spectator are strictly prohibited during any match. League administrators are allowed to remain in server spectator for any reason unless they are rostered on either team's Active Roster.

#### 8.6.1. Live Coaching
In-official coaching by **any** means is strictly prohibited. This includes during pauses, or before the commencement of a golden cap tiebreaker. This clause does not include coaching **outside** of an official match, such as demo reviewing or strategy sessions.

### 8.7. Player Swaps
Teams are allowed to swap players on their Active Roster during the match. For a team to switch a player out, the replaced player on the server must leave before the new player joins.

### 8.8. Mercenary Swaps
Teams are allowed to swap mercenaries during the match provided the other team approves the new mercenary. For a team to switch a mercenary out, the replaced mercenary on the server must leave before the new mercenary joins.

### 8.9. Pausing
Pauses during a match are allowed for any reason. The only exception is pausing immediately after readying up with the intent of delaying the match.

The match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause, however must receive the all-clear to unpause from the opposing teams. Unpausing has an in-built five-second countdown.

#### 8.9.1. Pause Limits
Each team is permitted two pauses per match with a combined total time limit of ten minutes. However, if team captains agree, the pause limit can be extended.

#### 8.9.2. Tactical Pauses
Tactical pauses *are* permitted, but contribute to the pause limits described above. Tactical pauses should not be used to disrupt ongoing plays (such as pushes). 

#### 8.9.3. Pause Command
To pause a match, teams simply need to open their console and send the following command:
```
pause
```

The same command can be sent to unpause the match.

#### 8.9.4. Repause Command
When a pause has been initiated to allow a player to rejoin a server, the following command may be used to allow them to rejoin their team:
```
repause
```

Using the repause command does not require warning the team.

### 8.10. Demo Recording
POV demo files must be recorded for all matches and must be provided at the request of an ozfortress administrator. **Players need to keep their POV demo files for at least two seasons.**

For more information, visit the [Demo Requests FAQ page](/faq/demo_requests/).

#### 8.10.1. Demo Checking
POV demo files may be requested by an administrator as a tool for resolving match disputes, ensuring competitive play integrity, or as a part of a random demo check.

Failing to provide POV demo files upon request will result in the following penalties:

- first instance: two round match ban
- second instance: two year ban
- further instances: two year ban

## 9. Broadcasting Matches
Official matches may be broadcasted on any live stream platform, but this match coverage should only ever come from an observer in SourceTV, or from a rostered player streaming their POV from the live server. Broadcasting an official from spectator in a live, official match server is **strictly prohibited**.

### 9.1. ozfortress Representation
ozfortress asks that all match broadcasts by both casting organisations and individuals follow a fairly simple philosophy: represent our community as one that is open and accepting. We feel this is fair, and doesn't impact anyone's right to voice their own opinion, even of ozfortress.

### 9.2. Approved Casting Organisations
Approved Casting Organisations do not require approval from the teams to broadcast the match. This status is reserved for casting organisations that demonstrate a high level of effort in production and coverage quality, contribute to fostering and improving talent, and do not purposefully misrepresent ozfortress.

The current Approved Casting Organisations are:

- KritzKast
- CappingTV
- BearCasts

Upon request, you must provide the Approved Casting Organisations with the following:

- the server's STV connect string
- the server's standard connect string, potentially including the RCON password (if required, they will inform you)
- an updated list of players and/or any mercenaries participating in the match (this should be provided at least an hour before the set match time)

The above rules apply to Approved Casting Organisations only.

#### 9.2.1. Becoming an Approved Casting Organisation
Casting Organisation representatives may contact the ozfortress General Head Administrator or Media Coordinator to receive the ability to promote their coverage and/or become an approved casting organisation. Approval will only be granted once it is determined by ozfortress that the coverage meets approved standards.

### 9.3. Unapproved Casting Organisations
Unapproved Casting Organisations or individuals may still cast official ozfortress matches. However, Approved Casting Organisations will have priority on matches they wish to cover. **Unapproved Casting Organisations must receive approval from both teams to cast a match**.

### 9.4. Player POV Streams
For players streaming their POV outside of a casted setting where STV delay is enforced, a minimum observable delay of at least ten seconds is expected. **Stream sniping is not considered an actionable offence** and it is the sole responsibility of the player streaming to ensure that their stream does not impact their team in any way.

---

## 10. Servers
### 10.1. SourceTV Settings
A match server **must** have an STV Delay (stv_delay) of **at least 90 seconds**. Reducing this during or before the match will result in harsh penalties. The same penalties apply if STV Map Change Protect is disabled during a casted official match.

### 10.2. Server Providers
For matches (and in the case of disputes), **au.serveme.tf** is the default server provider. However, in cases where both teams agree, alternative services like **Rhizome** or **Qixalite** may be used.

#### 10.2.1. Third-Party Servers
For those who wish to run their own, please see the required server configurations and plugins [here](/guides/selfmanaged_servers/). An ozfortress administrator must then review your server configs to ensure that the server is configured to a match-ready standard.

### 10.3. Server Locations
For matches (and in case of disputes), **Sydney** is the default server location. Teams can agree to play matches on alternative server locations, such as Melbourne, Perth, or Guam, however opposing teams are not obligated to agree to a server location change.

### 10.4. Server Interruptions
In the event of an ongoing match being interrupted, the match must be resumed from the time at which the last round was completed. Any ongoing rounds will be restarted and any rounds that were completed will remain completed.

## 11. Cheating, Exploits and Bans
### 11.1. Exploits
The intention of exploiting any aspect of the game for an unfair advantage, whether they are explicitly listed or not, is prohibited. We consider there to be two categories of exploits; **Game Modification exploits** and **Game Mechanic exploits**. Game Modification exploitation is the act of modifying game files (and typically bypassing sv_pure 2) to gain an unfair advantage. Game Mechanic exploitation is typically engine exploits, bugs, or abuse of unattended gameplay features that are outside the scope of competitive fairness and play.

#### 11.1.1. Game Modification
This is commonly treated as akin to cheating when malicious, as it is direct game file manipulation to gain an unfair advantage. Any item not explicitly stated as allowed is prohibited.

##### Explicitly Prohibited Game Modification
+ Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement or engine restrictions.
  - Panic scripts.
  - Bunnyhop scripts.
  - 180-degree Charge turn scripts.
  - Other turn scripts.
+ Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay, including but not limited to interpolation switchers, hud_reloadscheme stutters, or anything that causes a networked load on other clients or your own.
+ Sound-based exploits (spy decloak modifiers, footstep modifiers, audio mixers or equalizers, etc).
+ Sniper scope transparency/removal of the sniper scope.
+ Large shadows and/or box shadows.
+ Entering the player model default pose (“civilian pose”).
+ Removal/replacement of weapon sounds or particles (eg. transparent flame particles)
+ Removing map objects/props or making them transparent.
+ Malicious use of the retry command.
+ Uber Pause bug
    - A bug where medics continue to build Uber during a pause while healing a player. This bug should be prevented by server plugins, but in the event it does happen, both teams should be made aware and an administrator should be contacted.

A general rule of thumb for whether or not something is or isn't allowed is this:
> "Is the mod/custom file/change against a general sense of competitive integrity and fairness?" **If so it is likely prohibited.**

Please note this does not serve as a rule, and you should check with a League Admin before making use of any suspected exploit or game mechanic.

##### Explicitly Allowed Game Modification

+ Custom HUDs.
+ Custom Autoexec, class configs, etc.
+ Flat textures.
+ Custom Hitsounds & Killsounds.
+ No hats/cosmetics mods.
+ No explosion smoke mods.
+ Transparent viewmodels.
+ Non-malicious weapon sound replacement, some examples are:
    - Replacing hitscan or projectile weapon sounds.
        * Note: Replacement of anything that could be deemed malicious, ie. spy watch sound replacement is strictly prohibited.
+ Crouch jump script.
+ “C-tap” jump scripts.
+ Null-cancelling movement script.
+ Rocket jump script.
+ Mask uber script.
+ Say scripts (for example, class swap messages).
+ Loadout changing scripts.
+ Viewmodel / Crosshair switchers.
+ No explosions/particles smoke script.
+ Loadout change scripts and quick respawn scripts such as forward-spawn/backward-spawn scripts are explicitly allowed since Sixes Season 37 and Highlander Season 4, even if they preserve that class' current state:
    + This includes stickybomb projectiles, a medic's current medi-gun percentage and charge, an engineer's buildings, etc.

#### 11.1.2. Game Mechanic Exploits
Game Mechanic exploits are typically map, client or server exploits used to gain an unfair advantage.

+ Placing the Engineer’s buildings outside of the map, in indestructible locations or anywhere where it is not visible.
+ Entering areas that are “out of bounds” or not in playable space.
+ Resupplying by using spawn regions outside of spawn bounds.
+ Exploiting the map design to enter areas that aren’t within regular bounds, for any means or use excluding Wallbugs and Edgebugs as documented in [Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits](/rules/global/#explicitly-allowed-game-mechanic-exploits).
+ Map-based exploits (water jump scoping, etc).
+ Hiding sticky grenades (AKA "stickies") or engineer buildings inside of props or geometry **where they cannot be destroyed by normal means** (any class, out of the map, etc) due to differences in their visual and physical collisions is **considered an exploit**.

##### Explicitly Allowed Game Mechanic exploits

+ Wallbugs.
+ Edgebugs.
+ C-taps.

Reports made regarding exploitation are **reviewed on a case-by-case basis**.
The lists above are not exhaustive. **If you are unsure if something is considered an exploit**, **please contact an administrator** and request a ruling be made. Usage of any banned exploit or exploit with malicious intent **will** result in punishments. Punishments will range between **3 months** to **24 months** depending on multiple factors, including but not limited to **severity**, **intent**, **maliciousness**, etc.

### 11.2. Third-Party Software
The use of any third-party addons, hooks, programs or wrappers that interact with or alter the Team Fortress 2 client, its appearance or behaviour to gain an unfair advantage is a bannable offence. This includes usage of such programs on alternative accounts not registered with ozfortress.

### 11.3. Malicious Server Administration
The use of any server commands, variables, or plugins to gain an unfair advantage or to interfere with an ozfortress match is prohibited. Once the match is underway, the server administrator must let the match run its course and not make any changes without the consent of both teams.

### 11.4. Account Sharing
Sharing your login details with a third party for use in an ozfortress match is strictly prohibited and will result in lengthy bans for all involved parties.

!!! danger "Ban Penalty"
    **Account Sharing will incur a two year competitive ban**. Those found helping players who are currently banned evade their ban using either an Alternate Account or sharing someone else's account will receive the same penalty.

### 11.5. ozfortress Bans
Members banned on the ozfortress website are also banned from leading teams in ozfortress competitions. Players banned from the ozfortress website may also be subject to competition bans and are considered under probation. It is standard for those serving Competitive, Anti-Cheat or Infraction Threshold to be banned from our Discord server as well as being barred from using some bookable server services. Please contact an ozfortress administrator for further clarification.
