## Ban Types

Bans within ozfortress typically come as a result of poor player conduct, use of third-party cheat clients, use of exploits or breaches of our league rulesets. 

:::tip PLEASE NOTE
Ban reasoning is not limited to just the aforementioned reasons, administration reserves the right to make decisions for any case they deem necessary.
:::

There are five categories for ozfortress bans which are listed below:
+ **Evidence Bans**
> Cheating related bans, issued typically for usage of third-party programs to gain an unfair advantage, exploit usage, or outlier cheating cases that do not uphold the spirit of competitive play and sportsmanship.
+ **Infraction Threshold Bans**
> Poor player conduct and/or team conduct. You can find more information on these bans [here](../../rulesets/infractions/index.md).
+ **VAC Bans**
> No Conclusive Evidence of cheating in TF2. Entering a VAC Secured TF2 server with an administrator can revoke this ban. Players listed here are typically inactive and/or were unable to prove their VAC ban did not originate from TF2.
+ **Other Bans**
> Bans that fall outside some of the base categories above.
+ **Past Bans**
> As above, past bans that have expired.
