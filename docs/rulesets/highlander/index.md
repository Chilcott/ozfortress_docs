The following ruleset outlines the organisation and guidelines that players will need to follow for the ozfortress Highlander seasonal league. Please have a good working understanding of these rules before entering yourself into the competition.
Whilst these rules can be updated at any time, we endeavour to let players know of any changes through a front-page news post.
Ignorance of clauses within this ruleset is not an excuse.

[[TOC]]

## 1. League Format
### 1.1. Regular Season
The competition will be split into skill brackets (referred to as divisions) depending on the number of team signups.

The regular season will be played over 7 weeks, with playoffs/finals rounds running for a period of 3 weeks. It is a team’s responsibility to commit to the full length (10 weeks) of the season when they submit a signup application, failure to do so typically leads to disband penalties.

Two maps will be played for each regular season fixture, chosen by administration prior to the season's commencement out of a nine (9) map pool. Matches are expected to typically last just over an hour in a regular-season fixture. Playoff fixtures typically last longer and players should ensure to allocate and schedule accordingly.

### 1.2. Playoffs
At the conclusion of the regular season, the top four placing teams of each bracket advance to playoffs.

Playoff matches will each be a best of three (BO3) map series. Playoffs for all brackets will be played using the [Page playoff system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system).

### 1.3. Fixtures
Regular season match fixtures will be posted week to week after finalising each round. Fixtures are set at weekly intervals to be played between Monday and Friday.

Match pages will be posted on the Sunday prior to that round’s fixtures.

### 1.4. Round Robin
The Round Robin system ensures each team within a bracket faces each other. Round Robin is typically only possible with a specific amount of competitors, which also typically dictates the length of the competition.

[You can find more information about Round Robin here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament)

### 1.5. Swiss System
The Swiss system allows many competitors to compete against each other in a relatively small number of rounds. The first round will be scheduled randomly, and each subsequent round will be generated based on the previous results of teams. Teams with the same or similar records will be paired against each other, with the likelihood of duplicate matches minimised.

[You can find more information about the Swiss System here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)

### 1.6. Match Scoring
Each match consists of two maps; the winner of each individual map will be awarded two league points, while the loser is awarded zero. In the event of a map being drawn, see [Rule 1.8](/rulesets/highlander/#_1-8-draws).

Rankings will first be determined by these match points. If point draws exist, the following methods will be used to break them:

#### All Divisions
1. Match wins vs. Tied participants.
2. Median-Buchholz score (total).
3. Total match wins.
4. Win difference (Total points earned minus total points lost).

### 1.7. Forfeits
A maximum of two forfeits per team are permitted in ozfortress Highlander, on the third forfeit a team is considered inactive and removed from the league. Exclusion penalties will then apply for future ozfortress participation, administered via our disbands system. See Rule 2.5 for more information on disbanded and removed teams. Forfeiting a single map will result in the entire fixture being forfeited.

It is the team captain’s responsibility to contact your division’s League Administrator as soon as possible if there is a change in circumstances that will affect your team’s ability to field a team each round, even if it is a temporary problem.

**ANY forfeit in finals rounds will result in removal from the league and additional penalties for the offending team.**

#### Forfeit Types
##### Forfeit Win
A forfeit win will be awarded where the offending team has not made an effort to organise the match within the match organisation dates listed in this ruleset. Forfeit wins will also be considered as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match. A forfeit win will be recorded as a match win worth 4 league points. See [Rule 4.6](/rulesets/highlander/#_4-6-submitting-forfeit-wins) on how to submit a forfeit win.

##### Mutual Forfeit
Mutual forfeits will be applied where neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe. A mutual forfeit will be recorded as a match loss for both teams, worth 0 league points.

Mutual forfeits contribute to the 2-forfeit league removal count.

##### Technical Forfeit
A technical forfeit will be awarded in cases where situations outside the teams’ control occur, preventing both teams from playing the match, including but not limited to, Steam outages or major weather events. A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw, worth 2 league points for each team.

### 1.8. Draws
Draws on individual maps is not possible in the ozfortress Highlander Ruleset currently as only Stopwatch and King of the Hill formats are played.

### 1.9. Administrators
League Administrators are responsible for the efficient running of ozfortress competitions. Each bracket will be assigned League Administrators who will be the first point of contact for support and any disputes. However, all League Administrators can assist or deliver rulings on disputes if your bracket League Administrator is not available. The best way to get in contact with a League Administrator for help resolving match disputes is via our discord's #admin-support channel. You do not need to use pings there as we have notifications.

The Highlander Head Administrator is ultimately responsible for the general running and organization of the league.

### 1.10. Out of Region Teams and Players
ozfortress primarily caters to players from Australia and New Zealand, however, players from other areas such as Asia are welcome to compete with **express permission granted from a League Administrator**. Out of region players must still play on Australian servers (servers hosted in Sydney or Melbourne are available for booking through Discord) unless it is determined that using an alternative server is beneficial for both teams.

Each team is allowed a maximum of four (4) out of region players, all of whom need to be approved by a League Administrator.

Teams outside of our supported regions will be subject to further scrutiny during the signups process, and will typically not be approved. Players outside of our supported regions can participate but will be subject to the same scrutiny during the signups/transfers process.

### 1.11. Sportsmanship
Teams participating are required to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner in all communications.

Global chat is not fully restricted and may be used for light, friendly and tasteful banter. However, at the request of either team captain or an ozfortress League Administrator, chat may be restricted to only essential match communication. This request must be clearly stated in the global chat or the match thread.

Discrimination on the basis of, but not limited to, race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, or age will be regarded as an extreme breach of sportsmanship.

Breach of the sportsmanship clause may result in exclusion penalties to be determined by the ozfortress administration.

## 2. Teams
### 2.1. Application
Teams apply preseason to enter the league and nominate their desired bracket. A minimum of nine (9) eligible players are required for the application to be processed, however, we recommend that teams have a minimum of three backup/substitute players on their roster. It is expected that your team is available to play at least three days out of the five eligible days.

Roster sizes are capped at fifteen (15).

Players who have played in higher divisions than their team has applied for shall be reviewed by administrators prior to transfer or placement in their team. These players may be class restricted if they wish to play in the Open, Main or Intermediate brackets.

### 2.2. Player Eligibility
**To be eligible to be accepted onto a team’s roster, a player must:**
+ Have an ozfortress Citadel account.
+ Not be under any current competition exclusion penalties, including but not limited to:
  - Infractions
  - Competitive or Community Bans
  - VAC Bans

### 2.3. Captains
A team must nominate a player(s) to act as a captain to represent the team in organising matches and liaising with ozfortress League Administrators. This player(s) has the ultimate responsibility for their team. Captains may be excluded from acting as team captains for future competitions if ozfortress League Administrators consider them to be unfit to lead.

### 2.4. Mutiny Rule
A simple majority of registered team members may elect to nominate a new captain or remove the captain entirely, at any point of the season with the approval of the league coordinator. This may be used when a captain is the sole reason for an imminent disbanding of a team. In this situation, the team at large will remain without penalty.

### 2.5. Disbanded or Removed Teams
The captain of a disbanded or removed team will receive a tier two infraction, and all players on the Active Roster will be excluded from play for the remainder of that season. League Administrators will subject future applications from a disbanded or removed team to a closer review. In some instances, players may be banned from captaining teams in the future.

To avoid penalty, captains and/or team members should approach League Administrators at the first sign of trouble to determine a solution.

### 2.6. Transfers
Teams may transfer players on a weekly basis. The transfer application must be submitted by the deadline to be eligible for play in the following window. View how to apply for a transfer [here](https://ozfortress.com/transfers).

Teams will only be able to increase the size of their roster throughout the season to the roster limit of fifteen players. Teams with fifteen players may not increase their roster size through transfers unless enough players have been transferred out of their team to put their roster size under or at the limit.

Week 6 is the final week for transfers. League Administrators reserve the right to deny transfer applications based on numerous factors, and judgement will adapt to each transfer request. Players serving exclusion penalties in ozfortress will not be eligible for transfers until after their exclusion penalty has finished. Transfers should be approved by League Administrators no later than Sunday at 11:59 PM.

### 2.6.1. Player Pool
The Player Pool is the area of each team where players invited to the team are listed publically. Players within the Player Pool that are not on the Active Roster are counted as Mercenaries.

### 2.6.2. Active Roster
The Active Roster contains each and every player you count as a core or substitute player and can be used throughout the season. Players need to be requested to be transferred from the Player Pool to the Active Roster prior to their usage in an official match, otherwise, they will be counted as mercenaries.

### 2.6.3. Emergency Transfers
Emergency Transfers are granted by the staff team for situations where teams have an unavoidable player loss on their roster. The number of players granted and conditions are heavily case-by-case and up to the discretion of the staff team. The best way to request this process is via our support bot Alfred, as the entire staff team will immediately be able to see the request, but you can message your division or region administrator if need be.

### 2.7. Exclusions
Exclusions will be applied for repeated major rule breaches by a player or team. An exclusion will result in the immediate ejection of the player or team from the league, with potential prohibitions from playing in future competitions. In serious cases, exclusions may apply for first offences. Players/Teams can incur exclusions through our Infractions system as well, [which can be viewed here](https://ozfortress.com/infractions).

### 2.8. In-Game Medals
**The sale of in-game ozfortress medals (and any other medals) is strictly PROHIBITED.**

**Valve has a strict policy** that **league** and **tournament runners do not sell Medals/Promotional items** for any currency (in-game, monetary or otherwise), and this policy is also passed on to those who wish to receive said Medals/Promotional Items (meaning you, the player). 

Selling a slot on an active roster for in-game items or money is also **strictly prohibited**.

Individuals or parties caught selling/trading for medals will be reported directly to Valve.

## 3. Match Organisation
### 3.1. Negotiating Match Times
Each team must select a minimum of three days in which they are able to play. Captains may change your team’s availability on a week-to-week basis, which can be edited by clicking Manage on an Active Roster, found on the team's public page. You can also see both teams' availability on the match page. Once the match for the round has been posted, teams can begin negotiating to arrange a time and date for their match. If a match time has not been negotiated between the teams, the earliest matching day from both teams’ selections will be appointed as the default date. However, this default date can be changed under the agreement of both teams.

In addition to official match days, there are also official match times. These times are 8 & 9 PM Melbourne/Sydney time (AEST/AEDT depending on daylight savings time). Teams that can make this time will be looked upon more favourably than teams that can not.

It is expected that team captains or a nominated team member make a reasonable effort to organise their match before the organisation deadline. Team members who facetiously propose match times will be punished.

Communications in match threads are considered the authoritative log for all correspondence about match organisation. Teams may decide to (and are encouraged to) negotiate the match over Steam chat or other means, however, we recommend posting chat logs in the thread to prove that such correspondence has taken place in case of a dispute.

The negotiated time must always be posted in the thread.

If it is proving difficult to get in contact with the other team, or they are not making a reasonable effort to organise the match, please bring it to the attention of your bracket’s League Administrator immediately.

Teams may request an extension for a playoff match through their bracket’s League Administrator. If an extension is granted, both teams must agree on a date within the allocated time. Opposing teams are not obligated to play within the extended period although compromise and sportsmanship between teams are encouraged.

### 3.1.1. Match Communications
Match Communications are used to discuss the essential details for official ozfortress matches. It is expected that for the duration of discussion around an official match, teams and by extension players, do not post anything non-essential to the flow of the match.

The following should be present within all Match Communications:
+ Match date/day & times, or negotiation of such.
+ Any and all mercenary requests, along with approval of mercenaries.
+ logs.tf links for each map played.
+ Anything else that teams deem essential to the correct running of their official match.

### 3.2. Match Deadlines
**Match time set**: 7:00 PM Tuesday

**Results submission**: 11:59 PM Friday

### 3.3. Organisational Responsibilities
The responsibility for these tasks falls upon the team captain of each team. If they are unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, they must nominate another team member to ensure their completion.

### Both teams must:
+ Make an appropriate effort to organise the match.
+ Ensure attendance at the match.
+ Inform, and seek approval from the other team of any mercenaries and post their ozfortress.com profile and known applications in the match thread.
+ Inform League Administrators of any potential issues with the match, or of any disputes.
+ Submit or verify the final score prior to the score submission deadline.
+ Both teams must have the Picks & Bans process complete at a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours before the confirmed match date and time.
+ Maintaining a minimum of 7 players on the game server at all times.

### The home team must:
+ Organise the game server.
+ Appropriately administer the server during the match.

### Score Submission
**Teams must clearly state both the winner and match score of each map**. [logs.tf](https://logs.tf) links must also be linked.
::: tip Example
```
pl_upward: 1-0 Atomic Affinity logs.tf/xxxxxx (Regular Season)
pl_upward: 2-1 red pandas logs.tf/xxxxxx (Playoffs)
```
:::

### 3.4. Mercenaries
A mercenary is an unrostered player that is used in lieu of an unavailable team member. To be valid, mercenaries must have an ozfortress Citadel account and not be under any exclusion penalties.

Only **two** mercenaries per team are allowed in each match at any moment in time. Teams are allowed to swap mercenaries during the match provided the other team approves the new mercenary. 

Mercenaries may only be used at the **discretion of the opposing team captain**. There is no restriction on mercenary use if allowed by the opposing team captain. Do be aware that it is unlikely that opposing team captains will allow players of significantly larger skill to participate in the match and therefore reasonable requests are preferred.
Team captains do have the right to deny any mercenary, even if they are from a lower bracket. However, please do try to accommodate reasonable mercenary use, as you may find yourself in the same position. We recommend contacting a League Administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the potential mercenary.

**Mercenaries can only be sourced from the same division or below** (for example Premier players cannot play in Main matches unless approved by an administrator first), any mercenary found playing in a division below where they are currently or were recently playing will receive a penalty, along with the captain who requested them. If both teams agree to a Premier mercenary they can seek administrator approval for allowing that mercenary to play, but we reserve the right to deny mercenaries who we believe may be unreasonable, and if need be forcibly class lock or restrict them for match play in that division for the season duration.

When mercenaries are being requested, teams have the option to request them on a specific class. This would then lock them to that class during that match. Teams can also request a mercenary without specifying a class, allowing the mercenary to change classes at will. It is important to note that unless mercenaries have been explicitly allowed on one class, they are allowed to play a class of their choosing.

Manipulating other teams into allowing mercenaries is an infractable offence (e.g. If you allow us to use a high Premier player we will allow you to use a low Open player).

ozfortress League Administrator will act as arbitrators in such a case of unreasonable mercenary denial and may decide to overrule a team captain’s decision and allow a mercenary of a reasonable skill level.

Mercenary use **must be clearly stated** in the **match thread** where they are used. The information provided must include their SteamID and link to their ozfortress Citadel profile.

Use the [ozfortress Roster Verification Tool](https://verify.ozfortress.com/) to quickly verify all players prior to a match. To use the verifier, simply insert the status output from the console of the current match as well as the match link or ID. The tool will process your inputs and validate all players, displaying any inconsistencies with rosters.

### 3.5. Map Selection
Regular season matches will use two predefined maps from the map pool. The map pool consists of nine (9) maps, decided using data from seasonal polls.

Maps for playoff matches are selected by the captains of each team. This process can be performed before the match or in-game via chat but must be documented on the match page.

The selection process for a nine map pool (BO3)in Playoffs:
1. The **higher seeded** or **home team** will **ban first**.
2. The **lower seeded** or **away team** will **ban a map**.
3. The **higher seeded** or **home team** will **pick a map**.
4. The **lower seeded** or **away team** will **pick a map**.
5. The **lower seeded** or **away team** will **ban a map**.
6. The **higher seeded** or **home team** will **pick a map** from the remaining pool.

In the event of a disagreement, the home team will have a preference for team colour. In case of discrepancies between official rules and other sources, the most updated pick-ban order can always be found in match threads.

### 3.6. Match Disputes
To lodge a dispute or report misconduct, please contact an ozfortress League Administrator as soon as possible. Please do not bring the debate to the public as it is being resolved.

### 3.7. Fakenicking / Aliasing
Fakenicking / Aliasing is allowed in ozfortress matches that are not being casted by an Approved Casting Organization. When being casted by an approved organisation, players must use a name similar to their submitted roster name, and hence their ozfortress.com name, as to be generally recognizable to someone comparing team rosters with those on the server. Team organisation and sponsorship tags are allowed but must be reasonable. Players are encouraged to carefully choose their submitted roster name as name change requests are both monitored and selectively approved.

### 3.8. Default Server Location and Provider
ozfortress uses Qixalite’s server infrastructure to host bookable servers for competitive play. Currently, Qixalite supports various locations, but ozfortress will only allow the use of two regions, Sydney and Melbourne. 

For ozfortress official matches (and in case of disputes), the **official server location is Sydney**. Similarly to the default server location, ozfortress also has a default server provider, which is ozfortress bookable servers.

### 3.9. Server Location and Provider choice
The Home team or higher-seeded team for playoffs will be able to choose the server location, currently out of our two supported server locations, Melbourne and Sydney. The Away team or lower-seeded team can contact an administrator if they feel the location choice is malicious and in an attempt to disadvantage their team significantly. Administrators reserve the right to both overrule the decision made by the Home team, as well as deny requests for the location to be changed or defaulted. The Home team are also able to choose the server provider, but we highly encourage the use of Qixalite to run servers (booked either from the ozfortress or Qixalite Discords) and are again able to be disputed if the Away team believes there is malicious intent in their choice.

For the Regular Season, teams can discuss the server location with each other, but if they are unable to come to a resolution to their dispute, the default server location will be used.


## 4. Match Format
### 4.1. Team Eligibility Requirements
Teams must have a minimum of seven (7) rostered (does not include any mercenaries) players ready to start or continue a match.

### 4.2. Demo Recording
POV demos must be recorded for all ozfortress matches and must be provided at the request of an ozfortress League Administrator. We recommend using the demo recording system included in TF2, which can be activated under the advanced options menu in the game settings.

Demos are required to be stored for the current and past season.

**All players must be able to provide a POV demo before the date of their next official match if requested by a League Administrator. If you are unable to provide POV demos for a match you will face a 2 Round Exclusion for the first offence. Failing to provide POV demos a second time will incur a 2 Year Community and Competitive Ban. It is the player’s responsibility to ensure that demos are being recorded.**

### 4.3. Spectators
ozfortress League Administrators are the only approved spectators. Spectators are not allowed in any ozfortress match.

### 4.4. Pausing
Pauses during a match are allowed where players clearly exhibit technological performance issues or when teams wish to for personal reasons. Tactical pauses are allowed. In addition, the match may only be unpaused by the team who initiated the pause. Both teams must give the all-clear to unpause, which is followed by an in-built five-second countdown.

Each team is permitted two pauses per match with a combined total time limit of ten minutes. However, if captains are in agreement, the pause limit can be extended.

### 4.5. Casted Games
Official matches may be cast by organisations with the approval of the ozfortress League Administrators.

Casting organisation representatives may contact the ozfortress Head Administrator to receive the ability to promote their coverage and/or become an approved casting organisation. Approval will only be granted once it is determined by ozfortress that the coverage meets approved standards.

The ozfortress approved casting organisations are as follows:
+ KritzKast
+ CappingTV

Casting organisations may not directly influence the playing of an official ozfortress match in any way.

### 4.5.1. Approved ozfortress Casting Organisations
If your game is to be casted by an approved organisation, your team must provide to the caster(s), streamer, or organisation representative:
+ The server connects string, potentially including the RCON password (if the production team requires it, they will inform you).
+ An updated list of players and/or any mercenaries participating in the match. This must be provided at least an hour before the set match time.

The above rules apply to ozfortress-approved casting organisations only.

### 4.5.2. Unapproved ozfortress Casting Organisations
Casting organisations and individuals that are not approved by ozfortress may still cast official ozfortress matches, however, approved casting organisations will have precedence. If a team captain wishes to deny such a cast, they should discuss it with an ozfortress League Administrator.

### 4.5.3. Player POV streaming
Broadcasts of a player’s POV outside of a casted setting where STV delay is enforced, a minimum observable delay of at least ten (10) seconds is required. We define “observable delay” as a combination of personally set stream delay (for example in OBS) and standard Twitch/YouTube streaming delay. 

### 4.6. Submitting Forfeit Wins
Teams are expected to be readied up in the server by 15 minutes past the set match time. If your team is readied up in the server at such time, and the other team is not fully present or is refusing to ready up, please contact an ozfortress League Administrator to claim a forfeit win.

If the home team is not communicating, the away team is expected to book an ozfortress server and attempt to provide server details. If at 15 minutes past the home team has not joined the server or provided details to their own booked server, a forfeit win will be distributed.

If a team is unavailable to compete in a match and has communicated the forfeit, this must be posted with chat logs and confirmed on the match page.

### 4.7. ozfortress League Administrators as Referees
ozfortress may sometimes require certain matches to be refereed by an ozfortress League Administrator. In such a case, a post will be made in the match thread indicating this, and teams will be provided with a connect string before the match. If this happens, it is no longer the home team’s responsibility to administer the server or report the scores at the end of the round. League Administrators may also choose to be present on the server during playoffs matches or other important matches, and will request strings from players.

## 5. Servers
### 5.1. Server Configuration
[Instructions on how to download & install ozfortress seasonal league configs can be found here.](https://github.com/ozfortress/server-configs)

### 5.2. Preferred and Acceptable Servers
ozfortress bookable servers are considered the standard for matches. However, if both teams agree, an alternative server may be used. See Rule 5.3 for further details on Third-party servers.

If teams cannot agree on a server, an official ozfortress server must be used.

Administrators reserve the right to choose which server a match may be played on.

Please note: The server's SourceTV Delay (stv_delay) MUST remain at 90 seconds or above. Dropping this during or prior to your match will incur a penalty. The same can be applied to turning off STV Map Change Protect during a casted official match.

### 5.3. Third-Party Servers
For those who wish to run their own, servers must be running the official ozfortress configuration to be considered match-ready. They must also comply with the following requirements:
+ Be hosted on a dedicated, non-residential connection with enough bandwidth for at least 16 players.
+ Be running the current ozfortress seasonal league configs and whitelist and be running on sv_pure 2.
+ Be physically located in Australia, unless the match is between two New Zealand or two Asia based teams.
+ Running a logging system that uploads to [logs.tf](http://logs.tf/).
+ Not running any gameplay altering modifications outside of [TF2CompFixes by twiikuu](https://github.com/ldesgoui/tf2-comp-fixes).
+ [TF2CompFixes by twiikuu](https://github.com/ldesgoui/tf2-comp-fixes) must be loaded with all of the correct configurations.
+ Sourcemod plugins are not required but may be loaded as long as they are not considered gameplay-altering modifications.
+ Must have configured SourceTV to allow recording of STV Demos

If desired, an ozfortress League Administrator will review your server configs to determine if you have configured it to match-ready standard.

RCON for third-party servers must be provided to ozfortress League Administrators on request.

ozfortress League Administrators reserve the right to force a match to be played on an ozfortress server.

### 5.4. Restrictions
The ozfortress seasonal league runs on the following **Class Restrictions**:
+ 1 Scouts
+ 1 Soldiers
+ 1 Pyro
+ 1 Demoman
+ 1 Heavy
+ 1 Engineer
+ 1 Medic
+ 1 Snipers
+ 1 Spy

These limits must be enforced using the `tf_tournament_classlimit_X` commands. The full listing of these can be found in Rule 5.1.

Along with the above restrictions, we also run **Player Restrictions**, where eligible players are restricted from certain classes when playing in divisions lower than their skill. Player Restrictions vary depending on the number of divisions, surrounding teams and other players. 

These are not the only factors but are just some that we use to inform our decision-making. Breaking these Player Restrictions will incur a 1 Round Match Ban, along with a Forfeit Win awarded to the opposing team.

### 5.5. Whitelist
The standard ozfortress whitelist can be found on [whitelist.tf](https://whitelist.tf/ozfortress_hl). This will always redirect to the most recent whitelist in use for ozfortress competitions.

The in-game mechanic of weapon exchange and pick up is allowed.

### 5.6. Game Formats
The following formats are used in the ozfortress highlander seasonal league and have an associated configuration file in the ozfortress configs.

### 5.6.1. Stopwatch / Payload
Standard Stopwatch (Payload) maps are played as a Best of 1 where each team attacks and defends once in regular-season fixtures. For Playoff matches, Stopwatch is played in what is commonly referred to as the “ABBA” format, also known as a Best of 3 halves scenario. A half in Stopwatch is akin to a Best of 1 regular season fixture where each team attacks and defends once in that half, but in this Best of 3 scenario, the team that wins two halves will claim the win for that map. The following configuration represents this format:
```
mp_winlimit 3
mp_maxrounds 0
mp_timelimit 0
mp_tournament_stopwatch 0
```

Load this configuration using `rcon exec ozfortress_hl_stopwatch` or simply `rcon ozf-hl-stopwatch` on ozfortress servers.
When submitting your map/set scores for Stopwatch, the number of halves per team won is what needs to be reported. For example, 1-0 in a regular-season fixture, or 2-1 in a playoff match.

### 5.6.2. King of the Hill
King of the Hill (KOTH) maps are played first to 3 with no time limit. The following configuration represents this format:
```
mp_windifference 0
mp_maxrounds 0
mp_timelimit 0
mp_winlimit 3
mp_tournament_stopwatch 0
```

Load this configuration using `rcon exec ozfortress_hl_koth` or simply `rcon ozf-hl-koth` on ozfortress servers.
When submitting your map/set scores for KOTH, the end result (3-0, 3-1, 3-2, etc) is what you need to report.

### 5.7. Server Interruptions
In the event of an ongoing match being interrupted, the match must be resumed from the time at which the last round was completed. Any ongoing rounds will be restarted and any rounds that were completed will remain completed.

### 5.8. Server Spectator
The only players allowed on the server of an official match are the core or substitute players currently rostered on the active roster, or approved mercenaries. When substituting a player for a substitute or mercenary, the substitute or mercenary is allowed to join the server and swap with one of the other players, but the player being substituted must leave when they arrive.

### 5.9. Coaching
Currently, ozfortress does not allow in-official coaching via any means (for example; being in spectator, watching a POV stream via Discord, etc). This clause does not include coaching outside of an official match, like demo reviewing for example.

## 6. Cheating, Exploits and Bans
### 6.1. Exploits
The intention of exploiting any aspect of the game for an unfair advantage, whether they are explicitly listed or not, is prohibited. We consider there to be two categories of exploits; **Game Modification exploits** and **Game Mechanic exploits**. Game Modification exploitation is the act of modifying game files (and typically bypassing sv_pure 2) to gain an unfair advantage. Game Mechanic exploitation is typically engine exploits, bugs, or abuse of unattended gameplay features that are outside the scope of competitive fairness and play.

### 6.1.1. Game Modification exploits
This is commonly treated as akin to cheating when malicious, as it is direct game file manipulation to gain an unfair advantage. Any listed item not explicitly stated as allowed is prohibited.
+ Using scripts/macros that allow you to bypass movement or engine restrictions.
  - Panic scripts.
  - Bunnyhop scripts.
  - 180-degree Charge turn scripts.
  - Other turn scripts.
+ Other scripts that disrupt hitboxes or gameplay, including but not limited to interpolation switchers, hud_reloadscheme stutters, or anything that causes a networked load on other clients or your own.
+ Sound-based exploits (spy decloak modifiers, footstep modifiers, audio mixers or equalizers, etc).
+ Sniper scope transparency/removal of the sniper scope.
