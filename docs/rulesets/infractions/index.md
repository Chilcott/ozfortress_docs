## General Information

ozfortress enforces a set of Community Rules and Competitive Rules using a system of infraction points. You are issued infraction points that correspond to specific rule breaches and carry different points and expiration times. Each player starts with 0 infraction points.

Bans will be issued at different point levels, and carry different ban lengths and game bans depending on how many points you have accrued. Additionally, we list the infractions that can be issued and their corresponding rule.

A Community Ban restricts the player’s usage of all official ozfortress mediums including the ozfortress Discord and website. A Competitive Ban prevents the player from participating in any ozfortress leagues and competitions. Players serving bans will be blacklisted from all ozfortress servers and have their ozfortress.com accounts suspended for the duration of the ban. In the event that a player reoffends during their ban period, the additional penalty will be applied with consideration for time served.

Infractions themselves are considered warnings, and as such there are no warnings for offences listed here.

The Infraction team reserves the right to infract or ban players based on the offence, including offences committed whilst that player is already serving an infraction and/or ban.


## Community Behaviour Reporting
To submit evidence for a Community Behaviour Review, [please make a new thread here](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/new?topic=28).

(You will both need to have an ozfortress.com account and be signed in to make a submission).

Alternatively, you can also submit evidence for a Community Behaviour Review by making a new ticket under the “Community Behaviour Report” option in [#ticket-support](https://discord.com/channels/82651383144120320/963801705349271553) of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7E6kC2H).

Please note, your submission can only be seen by members of the Behaviour Panel and league administrators, but please be aware that in the process of verifying some evidence, or even when delivering the infraction, the offender may become aware of who submitted it inadvertently through the timing of the infraction's delivery, through the infraction itself, or by figuring it out themselves. While we endeavour to keep the reporter's anonymity, please understand that it is not always guaranteed.

## Ban Levels
+ 40 points = 3 round match ban
+ 60 points = 1 year Community and Competitive Ban
+ 90 points = 2 year Community and Competitive Ban

The 3 round match ban carries across from the offseason, so if it is received during the offseason, it will begin at the start of the next regular season for rounds one, two & three.

Infraction points do **not** expire after a user is banned. If a user receives a one-year ban involving a Tier 3 infraction, the infraction will still remain for the remainder of the two-year expiry after the player’s one-year ban has been served.
