# ozfortress Support
We understand that sometimes it's hard to wrap your head around specific rules, how something applies to your official matches, or what to do when in an active dispute with another team.

That's ok! We're here to help. Have a question about a rule, or something you can't find an answer to in our docs?

### Discord Support
We offer dedicated support channels to each competitive format we host, along with a `#ticket-support` channel for opening a support ticket directly with our staff, useful for more sensitive questions/disputes.

 - For Sixes (6v6) related questions or concerns, please use `#sixes-support`. If you wish to speak to an administrator directly, you can leave a message with "dm me" and an administrator will get back to you.
 - For Highlander (HL) related questions or concerns, please use `#highlander-support`. If you wish to speak to an administrator directly, you can leave a message with "dm me" and an administrator will get back to you.
