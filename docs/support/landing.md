# ozfortress Support & Reporting Hub
We understand that sometimes it's hard to wrap your head around specific rules, how something applies to your official matches, or what to do when in an active dispute with another team. Heck, what do you do if you need to report someone?

That's ok, we can answer those questions and more for you, just keep reading!

### Competition Support
Have a question, issue or dispute with another team? We offer dedicated support for each competition we run through our `#admin-support` channel in Discord. Don't hesitate to ask questions not pertaining to our competitions too! This channel will give you access to our support bot Alfred, who will make you a ticket with our staff. This ticket will be opened for you via Alfred, so make sure to check your Direct Messages on Discord!

## Reporting Player Behaviour
Not sure where or how to report player misconduct? We ask that you peruse through our docs pages before reporting player misconduct as these docs may contain information to help you help us when submitting your report.

<div class="grid-container">
  <a href="/rules/infractions">
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h5>Player Behaviour Infractions</h5>
    </div>

### Making a Report
To submit a report to the Behaviour Panel, [please make a new thread here](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/new?topic=28). Please note, we require that the template below is filled out. This template saves us time, and gives you a structured format to submit your report.

##### Submission Template
Below you'll find the template needed when making a Behaviour Report through [our website](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/new?topic=28).

```
Suspect(s) ozfortress.com account(s): 
Evidence (URLs / Media): 
Does any of your evidence need further verification? Yes/No
If you answered Yes above, provide verification:
Additional Notes (when it occurred, where, how, etc): 
```

!!!danger "Evidence Verification Requirements"
    If you are submitting evidence such as voice recordings, video evidence, screenshots of messages in in-game chat, or anything else that may need verification, please ensure you provide this verification within your report. For voice recordings, we ask that you screen record and show the account in question, same for video evidence. For screenshots of in-game chat, please provide either logs.tf links or server logs. If your screenshots are from Discord or Steam, we may ask you to provide the context around then, potentially via the Discord/Steam mobile apps as they are harder to manipulate/manufacture.

    For more information, please see the Report Requirements listed on our [Player Behaviour Infractions page](rules/infractions/#report-requirements). **If you are unsure how to verify some of your evidence, please feel free to reach out.**
